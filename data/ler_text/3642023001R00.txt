On June 14, 2023, Farley Unit 2 entered Mode 5 to conduct planned maintenance on the 2A Pressurizer Code Safety Valve
(PSV) which had indications of leaking. The PSV was removed from the system and delivered to a vendor to test in accordance
with Technical Specification (T/S) 3.4.10, Pressurizer Safety Valves.
On August 1, 2023, while in Mode 1 at 100% power level, Farley Unit 2 was informed by the vendor that the set pressure results
were outside of the T/S as-found acceptance criteria of 2423 - 2510 psig. During as-found testing the 2A PSV failed to lift.
Additional testing by the vendor using in-situ device identified that 2A PSV lifted at approximately 2599 psig. Although this value
is greater than T/S limits, the 110% ASME Code limitation and Safety Limit were not exceeded. The failure to lift within the
acceptable band was determined to be the result of internal steam cutting of the disc insert and nozzle. The 2A PSV was
replaced during the planned outage with a pre-tested spare.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION:
On July 8, 2022, it was identified that the 2A Pressurizer Code Safety Valve (PSV) [EEIS:AB/RV] began leaking as
evidence by elevated tailpipe temperatures and Pressurizer Relief Tank (PRT) parameters. The 2A PSV (Serial #
N56963-01-0001, Manufacturer: Crosby, Model: HB-86-BP) was installed on Unit 2 during refuel 27 (2R27) in the fall of
2020. The 2A PSV was monitored throughout the cycle, and a maintenance outage was planned based on the expectation
that pre-identified operational triggers would be met.
On June 14, 2023, Farley Unit 2 entered Mode 5 to conduct planned maintenance on the 2A PSV. Following the shutdown,
the 2A PSV was removed from the system on June 16, 2023, and delivered to a vendor to test in accordance with Technical
Specification (T/S) 3.4.10. The 2A PSV was replaced with a pre-tested spare. Unit 2 completed the planned outage and
reached Mode 1 on June 19, 2023.
On August 1, 2023, while in Mode 1 at 100% power level, Farley was informed by the vendor that the set pressure results
were outside of the T/S as-found acceptance criteria of 2423 - 2510 psig. During as-found testing at the vendor facility the
2A PSV failed to lift. Additional testing by the vendor using an in-situ device identified that 2A PSV lifted at approximately
2599 psig which is a 4.6% error of set pressure (2485 psig).
EVENT ANALYSIS:
Leakage past the seat was also identified during testing at the off-site facility. The cause of the 2A PSV failure to lift was
determined to be the result of excessive steam cutting of the valve disc insert and nozzle.
REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT:
Although the T/S pressure limit was surpassed, the ASME Code limitation and Safety Limit of 110% design pressure was
not exceeded. This failure constitutes a condition that is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), "Any operation or
condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications." Although seat leakage was evident while online
beginning in July of 2022 there is no firm evidence of when the failure to meet the lift setting requirements occurred prior to
the time of discovery at the test facility. There were no actual safety consequences for this event. No safety system
responses occurred. There was no release of radioactivity.
During operation, all three PSVs are required to be operable per T/S 3.4.10. The combined relief capacity of all three valves
is greater than the maximum surge rate resulting from a complete loss of steam flow to the turbine assuming no reactor trip
until the first Reactor Trip System trip set point is reached (i.e., no credit is taken for a direct reactor trip on the loss of load)
and assuming no operation of the pressurizer power-operated relief valves (PORV5) or steam dump valves. Each PSV is
designed to relieve 345,000 lbs per hour of saturated steam at the valve setpoint. The Reactor Coolant System (RCS) is
protected from overpressure regardless of a reactor trip, assuming all PSVs function properly. Should the reactor trip at the
first protection grade trip (High Pressurizer Pressure), then only 40% of the total valve capacity is required. This 40%
readily falls within that provided by the other two PSVs and protection from over pressurization can be expected. With the
two other operable PSVs this issue had very low safety significance. Additionally, this issue did not prevent the PSVs from
fulfilling their design safety function and the existing configuration risk monitor, Phoenix Risk Model (PRM), showed little to
no increase in risk due to the PSV being out of service.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
1. The 2A PSV was replaced during the June 2023 planned outage. The as-left setpoints were within +1- 1% tolerance.
2. The 2A PSV (SN N56963-01-0001) will be disassembled and inspected to include the replacement of the disc and
nozzle prior to re-installation in any future plant location.
3. Site annunciator procedures will be revised to provide operational guidance when PSV leakage occurs.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS:
This LER is the first PSV to have failed to lift or lift high based on a 10-year search; previous reports were based on PSVs
lifting early.
OTHER SYSTEMS AFFECTED:
No other systems were affected by this event.
