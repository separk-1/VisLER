On 11/12/2021 at 16:05, while Unit 3 was in Mode 3 at 0% power, through-wall leakage was verified from 3/8" tubing associated
with a Reactor Vessel Core Exit Thermocouple. The leakage was identified during the Class 1 leak inspection performed at
Normal Operating Pressure and Temperature (NOP/NOT) conditions at the end of the Unit 3 Cycle 32 refueling outage.
At 20:47, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A), FPL performed the 8-hour non-emergency notification to the NRCOC. Unit 3 was
brought to Mode 5 and the repairs were completed. The Class 1 leak inspection was satisfactorily performed after NOP/NOT
conditions were reestablished. Unit 3 has since been returned to service from the refueling outage and is operating at 100%
power.
This Licensee Event Report is required per 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(ii)(A).

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On 11/12/2021 at approximately 05:00, while performing the Unit 3 Class 1 primary system leak inspection at Normal
Operating Pressure and Temperature (NOP/NOT) conditions at the end of the Cycle 32 refueling outage, a small quantity
of boric acid was observed on a section of 3/8" stainless tubing associated with Core Exit Thermocouple (CET) 57. The
boric acid was cleaned by the inspectors and no evidence of leakage was immediately evident. At 16:05 the area was re-
inspected and boric acid was again present, indicating that a minor through-wall leakage flaw existed on the tubing.
Unit 3 entered TS 3.4.6.2.a for Reactor Coolant system (RCS) pressure boundary leakage. An 8-hour notification (EN#
55574) was made to the NRCOC at 20:47 pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A).
Unit 3 was brought to Mode 5 and the RCS was cooled and depressurized to establish proper maintenance conditions.
The flawed section of tubing was removed, and both open ends of the remaining tubing were capped. The CET was
abandoned in place. No other through-wall CET tubing flaws were identified.
CAUSE
The cause of the through-wall tube leakage is under investigation. The flawed tubing will be cleared for shipment and
analyzed to determine the failure mechanism. A supplement to this LER will be submitted after a probable cause is
determined.
SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE
This safety significance of this event was low. No safety system actuation was required. The through-wall leakage was
non-quantifiable and well within RCS makeup capability. No safety margins were challenged or reduced.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Corrective Actions will be assigned following the cause investigation and will be described in the supplement to this LER.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
EIIS Codes are shown in the format [IEEE system identifier, component function identifier, second component function
identifier (if appropriate)].
Analysis of the failed section of 3/8" tubing is expected to be completed by April 2022. A supplement to this LER will be
submitted after the appropriate cause investigation has been completed.
SIMILAR EVENTS
A review for CET pressure boundary leakage events over the previous 10 years was performed to identify similar events
or patterns. No similar events were identified.
