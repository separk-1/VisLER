At 1258 CDT on August 3, 2022, with Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the reactor
automatically tripped following a generator trip and subsequent turbine trip signal. A floor tile was dropped in the high voltage
switch house resulting in a relay actuation that electrically isolated Bus 1 in the 230kV switchyard. The "B" train emergency
safeguards (ES) bus lost power along with 1B, 1C, and 1E non safety related 4160V busses. The 1A 4160V non safety bus did
not fast bus transfer to its alternate power supply, which along with isolation of the 230kV Bus 1, resulted in all Reactor Coolant
Pumps being deenergized. Residual heat was removed by natural circulation via the atmospheric relief valves.
The 1B emergency diesel automatically actuated due to the loss of power to the 'B" train ES bus. In addition, the Auxilliary
Feedwater System (AFW) automatically started as expected in response to the reactor trip.
Corrective actions include calibrating the associated relays following revision to calculations and relay sheets. Additionally, the
design calculation change process will be revised to ensure plant impacts are incorporated into plant procedures.
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of multiple systems listed in 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). FNP Unit 2 was not affected during this event.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On August 3, 2022, at 1258 CDT, while Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power,
a transmission worker moving floor tiles in the high voltage switch house dropped a floor tile creating vibration near a relay
panel [EEIS: FK] which actuated relay TD-50 [EEIS: FK / 62]. Relay TD-50 is designed to isolate bus 1 of the 230kV
switchyard upon a fault. For Unit 1 this protection scheme resulted in the loss of the "B" Train Emergency Safeguards (ES)
bus [EEIS: EB] and Non Safety 4160V Busses 18 / 1C / 1E. Relays KD-10 (Distance Relay) [EEIS: FK/21] and KC-2
(Current Relay) [EEIS: FK / 67] are in series to protect the main generator from overcurrent. KD-10 actuated per design
when the 230kv bus 1 lost voltage. KC-2 is designed to actuate on high current through the generator output breakers. It
was determined post trip that KC-2 was set improperly. It was determined that while online at 100% power, KC-2 was in an
actuated state because the actual current was above its setpoint. Thus, when KD-10 actuated the circuit was completed to
send a trip signal to the main generator. The generator trip and subsequent turbine trip [EEIS:J WEL] resulted in an automatic
reactor trip [EEIS:AA/JC]. The 1B emergency diesel [EEIS: EK] automatically started upon the loss of power to the "B" train
ES bus. Subsequent to the automatic actuation of the reactor protection system (RPS), the auxiliary feedwater (AFW)
pumps [EEIS: BA] automatically started as expected. The 1A 4160V non safety bus did not fast bus transfer to its alternate
power supply, which along with isolation of the 230kV Bus 1, resulted in all Reactor Coolant Pumps [EEIS: AB] being
deenergized. Unit 1 residual heat was removed via natural circulation via the atmospheric relief valves immediately
following the event.
EVENT ANALYSIS
The cause of this event was a combination of a human performance event and a legacy relay setting error. The relay
actuations from the dropped floor tile, by itself, would not have resulted in a reactor trip. The KD-10 relay was actuated
upon the loss of the 230kV Bus 1, however had KC-2 been set properly, the generator trip and subsequent reactor trip
would not have occurred. The relay values of KC-2 had not been updated following a design calculation change, and the
design calculation change process did not identify when an update to associated relay settings sheets were required.
REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT
There were no safety consequences as result of this event. The operating crew responded appropriately to the event.
This event was within the analysis of the UFSAR Chapter 15. Additionally, no radiological release occurred due to this
event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the RPS, the 1B
Emergency Diesel, and the AFW system as identified in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B).
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED
1.R evise Design Calculation and update relay setpoint sheets.
2. Calibrate KC-2 relay to new setpoints.
3. Revise the governing procedures for the design calculation change process.
4. Incorporated improved work control zones and labeling in the switchyard relay house.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
There were no events from the last three years with either the same or similar cause to this event.
