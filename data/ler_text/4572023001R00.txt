On September 1, 2023, an oil sample from the 2B auxiliary feedwater (AF) pump diesel engine was obtained. On September
21, 2023, the oil sample results were received which indicated oil viscosity and fuel percent in the Fault range, and a
confirmatory sample was drawn. On September 22, 2023, resample results were received confirming the original analysis, and
at 1157 Operations declared the 2B AF train INOPERABLE and entered Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for
Operation (LCO) 3.7.5, "Auxiliary Feedwater (AF) System," Condition A, "One AF train inoperable." Maintenance was
performed to repair fuel leaks and crankcase oil was changed. The 2B AF train was returned to service on September 23,
2023, at 1340, and at 1501 LCO 3.7.5 was exited.
The cause of the event was vendor performance and quality control gap in refurbishing fuel injectors. The corrective action was
repair of the 2B AF diesel engine lube oil fuel leaks. A supplement to this report will be provided as more information is
available.

NARRATIVE
A. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event:
Event Date:(cid:9) September 22, 2023
Unit: 2(cid:9) MODE: 1(cid:9) Reactor Power: 100 percent
Unit 2 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB]:(cid:9) Normal operating temperature and pressure
No structures, systems or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to the event.
B. Description of Event:
On September 1, 2023, an oil sample from the 2B auxiliary feedwater (AF) [BA] pump diesel engine was obtained. On
September 21, 2023, the oil sample results were received which indicated oil viscosity and fuel percent in the Fault
range (defined per process documents as a serious deviation from normal operating condition), and a confirmatory
sample was drawn. On September 22, 2023, resample results were received confirming the original analysis, and at
1157 Operations declared the 2B AF train INOPERABLE and entered Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition
for Operation (LCO) 3.7.5, "Auxiliary Feedwater (AF) System," Condition A, "One AF train inoperable."
Maintenance was performed on the diesel engine including crankcase oil change and repair of fuel leaks. The 2B AF
train was returned to service on September 23, 2023, at 1340 and at 1501 LCO 3.7.5 was exited.
The investigation of the event and whether the diesel engine would have been able to meet its TS mission time is in
progress. TS LCO 3.7.5 Condition A requires restoring the AF train to OPERABLE status within 72 hours or in
accordance with the Risk Informed Completion Time Program. In the event the investigation determines the 2B AF
train was unavailable for a longer period of time than allowed by LCO 3.7.5 Condition A, this event is being reported
pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by TSs. Additionally, on both
September 20, 2023 and September 21, 2023, the 2A AF train was inoperable for surveillance testing. Due to the
possibility of determining the 2B AF train was unavailable during the same timeframe, this event is also being reported
pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of
structures or systems that are needed to remove residual heat.
C. Cause of Event
The investigation of the event is in progress and any changes to the final root cause will be included in a supplement to
this report. The apparent cause of the event was vendor performance and quality control gap in refurbishing fuel
injectors being provided to meet quality level 1 criteria. Two refurbished fuel injectors provided to the site and installed
in the 2B AF diesel engine contained surface defects on the injector cap sealing surface, one of which was confirmed
by testing to leak under designed installation conditions, and a third fuel injector contained a degraded O-ring which
also allowed leakage. Vendor is evaluating for 10 CFR Part 21 submission.
D. Safety Consequences:
This condition had no actual safety consequences impacting plant or public safety.
The investigation of the event is in progress, and a supplement to this report will be provided as more information is
made available.

E. Corrective Actions:
The 2B AF diesel engine fuel leaks into lube oil were repaired and performed a crankcase oil change.
Further corrective actions are still under consideration and any revisions or additions will be reported in a supplement
to this report.
F. Previous Occurrences:
April 10, 2019, Braidwood Unit 1, the 1B AF pump engine degrading trend in fuel oil content was identified. Evaluation
identified the cause as most likely a leaking fitting within the rocker/valve cover. No operability or reportability issues
resulted. The cause of the leakage in 2019 is unrelated to the current issue.
