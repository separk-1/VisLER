16. Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On October 7, 2022, during a Liquid Penetrant examination on the embedded flaw seal weld repair of Control Rod Drive
Mechanism Penetration 69, five 1/4-inch rounded indications were discovered that were determined to be unacceptable
per the acceptance criteria in ASME Section III.
The cause of these indications is attributed to existing mechanical discontinuities/minor subsurface voids growing or
opening to the weld surface due to thermal and/or pressure stresses during plant operation. The indications were
reduced to an acceptable dimension by grinding/blending the indications to meet the applicable acceptance criteria in
ASME Section III.
This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A), "any event or condition that results in the condition
of the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously degraded" since the as-found indications
did not meet the applicable acceptance criterion referenced in ASME Section III to remain in service without repair.

Event Date:(cid:9) October 7, 2022
Unit: 1(cid:9) MODE: 6
Unit 1 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB]:(cid:9) Not Applicable
No structures, systems or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to the event.
B. Description of Event:
On October 07, 2022, a Liquid Penetrant (PT) examination on the embedded flaw seal weld repair of Control Rod
Drive Mechanism (CRDM) Penetration 69 was performed. During the PT examination, five unacceptable 1/4-inch
rounded indications were discovered on the embedded flaw seal weld repair of the penetration. Rounded
indications that exceed 3/16 inches in any dimension are unacceptable per the acceptance criteria in ASME
Section III.
• The first indication is a 1/4-inch rounded indication located at 90 degrees at the weld saddle of the penetration.
• The second indication is a 1/4-inch rounded indication located at 90 degrees on the nozzle portion of the seal
weld and 0.5 inches from the transition of the head to the penetration.
• The third indication is a 1/4-inch rounded indication located at 90 degrees on the nozzle portion of the seal weld
and 1.5 inches from the transition of the head to the penetration.
• The fourth indication is a 1/4-inch rounded indication located at 180 degrees on the nozzle portion of the seal
weld and 1 inch from the transition of the head to the penetration.
• The fifth indication is a 1/4-inch rounded indication located at 180 degrees on the nozzle portion of the seal
weld and 2.5 inches from the transition of the head to the penetration. This indication was discovered during a
prior TP examination in refueling outage Al R21 (October 10, 2019), and at the time was at an acceptable size
per ASME Section III. This was the only indication of the five that was present during a prior examination.
0 degrees azimuth is the location at the outermost portion of the penetration on the flange side (downhill/outermost
side). The transition is the point where the vertical portion of the penetration meets the horizontal area of the
reactor head.
This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A), "any event or condition that results in the
condition of the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously degraded" since the as-
found indications did not meet the applicable acceptance criterion referenced in ASME Section III to remain in
service without repair. This LER is being submitted in follow-up to ENS 56153 made on October 7, 2022, at 0735
CDT.
C. Cause of Event
The cause of these indications is attributed to existing mechanical discontinuities/minor subsurface voids growing
or opening to the weld surface due to thermal and/or pressure stresses during plant operation. Unacceptable
rounded indications have previously been identified on the embedded flaw seal weld repair on CRDM Penetration
69.

NARRATIVE
D. Safety Consequences:
This condition had no actual safety consequences impacting plant or public safety.
Each unacceptable indication was identified in a timely manner during routine inspection activities and repaired
prior to through wall leakage occurring. None of the indications penetrated through the embedded seal weld repair.
Were these indications to go undetected, they could have potentially propagated through the embedded seal weld
repair over time, creating a leak path through the reactor coolant pressure boundary. With these required
inspections being performed at the required intervals, detected degradation that does not meet acceptance criteria
will be repaired or evaluated prior to reaching any level of significance. This condition is limited to CRDM
Penetration 69 at Braidwood Unit 1. CRDM Penetration 69 is the only penetration at Braidwood Unit 1 that has
been repaired utilizing this embedded flaw seal weld repair method.
Bare metal visual examination on the reactor vessel closure head did not detect any evidence of reactor coolant
pressure boundary leakage. Volumetric examination did not detect any evidence of through-wall reactor coolant
pressure boundary leakage. Based on the characteristics and dimensions of the unacceptable indications
discovered during PT examination, there was no loss of safety function due to these indications.
E. Corrective Actions:
Actions were completed to grind/blend the indications to remove or reduce the indication size to meet the
applicable acceptance criteria in ASME Section III. Progressive PT examination was performed during the
grinding/blending to determine if the indications met acceptance criteria, and all five of the previously unacceptable
indications were determined to meet acceptance criteria via PT examination.
F. Previous Occurrences:
Previous Licensee Event Reports were made in June 2012, November 2013, June 2015 and November 2016 at
Braidwood Station Unit 1 for indications on CRDM penetration 69 (LER 2012-002-00, LER 2013-002-00, LER 2015-
002-00 and LER 2016-003-00).
