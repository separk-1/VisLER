16. Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On 2/18/2022, at 0449 hours, McGuire Nuclear Station Unit 2 Digital Electro-Hydraulic Control System (DEH)
experienced a component failure causing a spurious rapid turbine load rejection and un-demanded closure of Throttle
Valves (TV) #2 and #4. During the event, the DEH system reverted to manual control, reactor power decreased, and
plant systems responded as expected. Due to plant stability concerns, the reactor was manually tripped at 0459.
Following the reactor trip, steam generator (SG) levels decreased to the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) autostart
setpoint and all AFW pumps started as expected and began providing feedwater to the SGs. This additional SG input
lowered reactor coolant average temperature and resulted in a Feedwater Isolation as designed. The reactor trip was
uncomplicated with all systems responding normally post-trip.
Subsequent analyses determined that an electrical disturbance, originating from within the DEH control system
cabinet caused DEH to react in an unexpected manner and produce un-demanded turbine valve movement. A contributing
factor is that some DEH circuit cards had embedded batteries operating past their expected service life. These cards did not
retain control logic and did not reconfigure as expected when reenergized. Corrective actions included hardening the DEH
system by performing power-to-ground audits and replacing failed controller modules, cabinet power supplies, and a
subset of circuit cards with embedded batteries. A DEH replacement project is currently in the design phase
scheduled for implementation in Fall 2024 (Unit 2) and Spring 2025 (Unit 1).

NARRATIVE
BACKGROUND
The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER.
Applicable Energy Industry Identification [El IS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets.
Reactor Protection System [JC]:
The Reactor Protection System (RPS) keeps the Reactor operating within a safe operating range by
automatically shutting down the Reactor whenever the limits of the operating range are approached by
monitoring process variables. Whenever a direct or calculated process variable exceeds a setpoint the
Reactor is automatically tripped to protect against fuel cladding damage or loss of RCS integrity. Station
operators may elect to manually actuate the reactor trip switchgear (manual reactor trip) using either of two
control board switches.
Engineering Safety Feature Actuation System [JE]:
The Engineering Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) initiates necessary safety systems, based on
the values of selected unit parameters, to protect against violating core design limits and the RCS pressure
boundary, and to mitigate accidents.
Feedwater System [SJ]:
The Feedwater System takes treated Condensate System water, heats it further to improve the plant's
thermal cycle efficiency, and delivers it at the required flow rate, pressure, and temperature to the steam
generators (SGs). The Feedwater System is designed to maintain proper vessel water levels with respect to
reactor power output and turbine steam requirements.
An Automatic Feedwater Isolation (FWI) signal will occur if any of the following conditions occur: (1) Safety
Injection actuation, (2) Hi Hi SG level (83% Narrow Range on 2/3 channels on 1/4 SGs), and (3) Reactor trip
with low Tave (P-4 and < 553 degrees Fahrenheit (F) on 2/4 loops).
Digital Electro-Hydraulic Control System [JJ]:
The purpose of the Digital Electro-Hydraulic (DEH) Control System is to control the speed and load of the turbine
generator by positioning the throttle and governor valves to control steam flow to the turbine.

BACKGROUND (continued)
Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA]:
The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically supplies feedwater to the SGs to remove decay heat
from the RCS upon the loss of normal feedwater supply. The AFW mitigates the consequences of any event
with loss of normal feedwater. The design basis of the AFW is to supply water to the SGs to remove decay
heat and other residual heat by delivering at least the minimum required flow rate to the SGs.
The AFW is designed to start automatically for any event requiring emergency feedwater.
The AFW Motor Driven Pumps will automatically provide feedwater when initiated on any of the following
conditions:
1. Trip of both main feedwater pumps
2. AMSAC Actuation (AMSAC - Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) Mitigation System
Activation Circuitry)
3. Two out of four (2/4) low-low level alarms in any one SG
4. Initiation of a safety injection signal
5. Loss of power to the 4160V essential bus (Blackout)
The AFW Turbine Driven Pump will automatically provide feedwater when initiated on any of the following
conditions:
1. Two out of four (2/4) low-low level alarms in any two SGs
2. Loss of power to the 4160V essential bus (Blackout)
3. 1/1 detector from Standby Shutdown Facility (SSF) SG Wide Range Low-Low Level on 2/4 SGs (72%)
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On 2/18/2022, at 0449 hours, McGuire Nuclear Station Unit 2 Digital Electro-Hydraulic Control System (DEH)
experienced a component failure causing a spurious rapid turbine load rejection and un-demanded closure of
Throttle Valves (TV) #2 and #4. During the event, the DEH system reverted to manual control, reactor power
decreased, and plant systems responded as expected. The DEH graphical display and control board megawatt
output display indicated full power values and did not update as expected in response to changes in governor and
throttle valve positions.
Due to plant stability concerns, the reactor was manually tripped at 0459. Following the reactor trip, SG
levels decreased to the AFW autostart setpoint (17 percent narrow range level) and all AFW pumps (i.e., the
2A AFW Motor Driven Pump, 2B AFW Motor Driven Pump, and Unit 2 AFW Turbine Driven Pump) started as
expected and began providing feedwater to the SGs. This additional SG input lowered reactor coolant
average temperature to less than 553 degrees F on 2/4 loops and resulted in a Feedwater Isolation as
designed. The reactor trip was uncomplicated with all systems responding normally post-trip.

similar DEH response indicate that the governor valves moved rapidly to throttled positions lower than
expected for a load rejection but did not fully close based on steam flow to the main turbine. The simulator
runs were able to mimic the load rejection. throttle valve response. and other conditions observed by
operators during the event.
REPORTABILITY DETERMINATION
The Unit 2 RPS actuation while critical was a valid actuation and initially reported, as required, under 10 CFR 50.72
(b)(2)(iv)(B), "Any event or condition that results in actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) when the
reactor is critical except when the actuation results from and is part of a pre-planned sequence during testing or
reactor operation." The event also resulted in the valid actuation of the TDCA pump and MDCA pumps and was
initially reported, as required. under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). This LER satisfies the corresponding written
reporting criteria in 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic
actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)." The applicable 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)
systems include the Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System.

CAUSAL FACTORS
Subsequent analyses determined that an electrical disturbance, originating from within the DEH control
system cabinet, caused DEH to react in an unexpected manner and produce un-demanded turbine valve
movement. A contributing factor is that some DEH circuit cards had embedded batteries operating past their
expected service life. When these circuit cards reenergized after the electrical disturbance, they lost their memory
and did not reconfigure as expected. For example, the DEH graphical display and control board megawatt output
display indicated full power values and did not update as expected in response to changes in governor and throttle
valve positions.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Immediate actions included hardening DEH by replacing the failed controller modules, cabinet power supplies, and
a subset of circuit cards with embedded batteries. Power-to-ground audits were performed before and after
replacement of the cabinet power supplies. Furthermore, DEH cabinet ground checks, DC control voltage power
quality checks, and the DEH outage preventive maintenance testing procedure were performed.
Additional actions, which include the following, will be performed in the next scheduled outage for each unit:
• Perform full cabinet energized cable/termination checks/testing
• Cabinet/card thermography
• Replace controller modules with manufacturer refurbished/tested units, including new battery-backed
memory chips
• Replace cabinet power supply chassis and power monitoring module
• Perform cabinet power quality and grounding testing
A DEH replacement project is currently funded and in the design planning phase scheduled for replacement in Fall
2024 (Unit 2) and Spring 2025 (Unit 1).
SAFETY ANALYSIS
Following the reactor trip, SG levels decreased to the AFW autostart setpoint and all AFW pumps started
as expected and began providing feedwater to the SGs. This additional SG input lowered reactor coolant
average temperature and resulted in a Feedwater Isolation as designed. Operators manually tripped the
reactor in accordance with plant operating procedures. The reactor trip was uncomplicated with no impact
to the health and safety of the public.
A post-trip review found no procedural or human performance issues with the operator response.
Furthermore, there was no equipment out of service or safety significant activities in progress at the time of
the event that contributed to the event. Excluding the DEH malfunction, plant systems responded as
expected. Therefore, it is concluded that the impact on core damage risk was very small, and the event
had no impact on public health and safety.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
A review of the McGuire corrective action program was conducted to determine if this was a recurring event
(i.e., similar event with the same cause or same failure mode). No previous similar events were identified
within the past three years associated with a reactor trip caused by failure of the DEH system. Therefore,
this is not considered a recurring event.
