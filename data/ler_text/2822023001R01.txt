At 11:10 on October 19, 2023, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Unit 1 operating at 100 percent power in Mode 1,
power operations, multiple substation breakers unexpectedly opened and multiple grounds were detected on DC control power
cabling from the plant to the substation control house. This resulted in a Unit 1 Turbine Trip and subsequent Reactor Trip with a
loss of all non-safety related busses and the actuation of Auxiliary Feedwater and Emergency Service Water. Operators
responded to the event in accordance with approved procedures and safely placed the plant in Mode 3.
Horizontal directional drilling in progress at the site damaged DC control cables resulting in the identified plant response. This
was caused by weakness in the Excavation Permit approval process as well as inadequate oversight of the personnel performing
the work. DC cable replacement has been completed and multiple procedure changes have been initiated to address the
identified gaps and prevent recurrence of this event.
There were no radiological impacts from the event. The health and safety of the public and site personnel were not impacted
during this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a Reactor Trip, a valid Auxiliary Feedwater
actuation of Emergency Service Water system.

NARRATIVE
Plant Operating Conditions Prior to the Event:
Unit 1 - Mode 1, 100 percent Power
Unit 2 - Defueled
EVENT DESCRIPTION
At 11:10 on October 19, 2023, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) Unit 1 operating at 100 percent
power and Unit 2 defueled in a scheduled refueling outage, multiple substation breakers, including the Unit 1 generator
output breaker, unexpectedly opened causing a Unit 1 Turbine [TA] Trip and subsequent Reactor Trip. In addition, multiple
grounds were detected on DC control cabling for both Units from the plant to the substation control house. The Turbine
Trip caused 1M Main Transformer to become deenergized, which is the normal power supply to non-safety related (NSR)
busses on Unit 1. 1R Auxiliary Transformer was also deenergized as a result of the event and therefore was not available
for a Fast Bus Transfer, which resulted in a loss of all NSR busses on both Units.
The reactor trip resulted in Steam Generator Water Level (SGWL) in both Steam Generators rapidly shrinking to below the
setpoint for an automatic start of both Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[BA] pumps. These pumps ensure that at least one
Steam Generator contains enough water to serve as the heat sink for reactor decay heat and sensible heat removal
following a reactor trip. Both the 11 Turbine Driven AFW Pump and 12 Motor Driven AFW Pump actuated upon reaching
the automatic start setpoint for low SGWL.
The 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) auto started on low header pressure due to the loss of the NSR 11
Cooling Water (CL) Pump. The 121 MDCLP is designed to start automatically if CL header pressure drops to 80 pounds
per square inch gauge (psig). The 121 MDCLP is a part of the PINGP Cooling Water (CL) System [BI]. The CL system is
a ring header which is shared by Units 1 and 2 that provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operational heat
from safety-related components during a design basis accident or transient.
At 14:15 on October 19, 2023, Event Notification (EN) # 56803 was reported to the NRC as a 4-hour Non-Emergency
report under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) actuation of the reactor protection system and 8-Hr Non-Emergency report under
10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for an Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation.
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a trip of the Unit 1 reactor, a valid Pressurized Water
Reactor (PWR) Auxiliary Feedwater actuation for Unit 1 and actuation of Emergency Service Water system (121 MDCLP
for Unit 1 and Unit 2).
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
All control rods were fully inserted into the core following the trip. All safety functions operated as designed. This event
does not represent a safety system functional failure for Unit 1 or Unit 2.
AFW actuated as expected. The AFW System automatically supplied feedwater to the Steam Generators to remove
decay heat from the Reactor Coolant System when SGWL shrunk after the reactor trip. Decay heat was removed by the
Steam Generators through the Steam Generator Power Operated Relief Valves.
The auto start of 121 MDCLP did not challenge nuclear safety as the Cooling Water system responded as designed.

NARRATIVE
Prior to the event, Spent Fuel Pool (SFP) cooling was being maintained with both trains operating. When Unit 1 tripped,
the 121 SFP pump went offline, but cooling was still maintained with the 122 SFP pump. No impacts to the SFP
temperature were observed.
There were no radiological impacts associated with this event. The health and safety of the public and site personnel were
not impacted during this event.
CAUSE OF THE EVENT
As part of an ongoing project to replace one of the AC power cables between the substation and the plant, non-nuclear
supplemental workers had been performing horizontal directional drilling (HDD) activities at PINGP for several days prior
to this event. On the morning of October 19, 2023, the HDD crew began to bore a hole for the 5th conduit pull . At 11:10,
the directional drilling equipment traveled through a DC cable bundle containing control cables, causing damage which
resulted in the opening of multiple substation breakers in the switchyard [FK] leading to a Unit 1 Turbine Trip and
subsequent Reactor Trip. This also resulted in a loss of all NSR busses on both Units and the actuation of Unit 1 AFW and
121 MDCLP.
The root cause of this human performance issue was weakness in the Excavation Permit approval process as well as the
inadequate oversight of the non-nuclear supplemental workers performing HDD work.
Weaknesses were identified in the Excavation Permit approval process for the planned HDD work. Site personnel
reviewing and approving the permit were not adequately intrusive to ensure that all interferences had been properly
identified prior to approving the permit. Specifically, the use of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) had only been
completed for some areas and had not been performed in the area that would have identified the interference with the DC
cables.
Additionally, procedural weaknesses and poor communication between site departments allowed the HDD work to
continue without a clear understanding of which site department was responsible for providing oversight to the HDD crew.
This resulted in work progressing in the field without all controls in place that would be expected for work at a nuclear
plant. Specifically, approved work plans were not always available at the work site and approved construction drawings
for HDD work were not updated when changes were made in the field.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The station has replaced the damaged DC control cables. The existing cables were abandoned in place. Equivalent
conduits and cables were installed between the substation and plant.
To prevent similar events occurring in the future, multiple procedure changes have been initiated to address the gaps with
the oversight of non-nuclear supplemental worker process and the Excavation Permit approval process.

NARRATIVE
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
On October 17, 2021, the PINGP 2RY Transformer was de-energized when operations personnel opened the 2RSY
Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch instead of closing the 2RSX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer
34.5KV B Disconnect Switch during restoration of the 2RX Transformer in the substation. The de-energization of 2RY
caused a loss of power to the Unit 2 4.16 KV Bus 23. This led to an auto-start of 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump
on a sensed low header pressure. The cause of the de-energization of 2RY was individual errors during hard match and
concurrent verification. This was reported under LER 50-282/2021-002-00. Corrective actions for this event were revision
to fleet standards to upgrade all substations switching activities to high risk to ensure supervisory oversight and
appropriate barriers to reduce human error and preclude event. These corrective actions would not have prevented the
incident that occurred in this LER.
On October 17, 2023, a substation breaker unexpectedly tripped open due to an incorrect trip switch being operated by
non-nuclear supplemental workers. This caused a momentary loss of offsite power to safeguard Bus 16 until the
safeguards load sequencer transferred the bus to the 1R transformer source. This incident occurred because the crew
failed to verify the component being manipulated matched the component specified in the procedure. This event
happened two days prior to event reported per this LER and not all corrective actions for this event had been
implemented.
