At 2230 eastern daylight time (EDT) on July 18, 2022, operators declared the 1B-B Centrifugal Charging Pump
(CCP) inoperable and entered Condition A of the Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation
(LCO) 3.5.2 for one or more trains of the Emergency Core Cooling System inoperable. Enforcement discretion of
TS LCO 3.5.2 was requested because the estimated time required to troubleshoot, repair, and test the 1B-B CCP
would exceed the 72 hours allowed by Condition A. The request was granted for a period of 69 hours not to
exceed a total time of 141 hours. At 1635 EDT on July 24, 2022, the 1B-B CCP was declared OPERABLE.
Because the 1B-B CCP was inoperable for approximately 138 hours and the unit was not placed in MODE 3 within
78 hours, this constitutes an operation or condition prohibited by TSs.
Disassembly of the 1B-B CCP element showed severe wear on impellers 11 through 6 and less severe wear on
impellers 5 through 1. The wear was on one side of the impellers. This is indicative of shaft bowing. Dye
penetrant examination of the shaft showed a crack in the split ring keeper key groove at the 11th stage impeller.
Pending completion of the destructive analysis, the most likely cause of the failure is low stress, high cycle fatigue.
The 1B-B CCP element was replaced. Corrective actions include implementing preventative maintenance tasks to
periodically replace CCP shafts.(cid:9) There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event as the
1A-A CCP was started and available until the 1B-B CCP was OPERABLE.

NARRATIVE
I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event
At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated
thermal power.
II. Description of Event
A. Event Summary:
At 2130 eastern daylight time (EDT), on July 18, 2022, operators in the main control room
(MCR) noticed that the pressurizer [EIIS: PZR] level was slowly lowering with the downstream
flow control valve near 100 percent open with the 1B-B Centrifugal Charging Pump (CCP)
[EIIS: CB] [EIIS: P] in service. Thereafter, operators received an unexpected alarm for low flow
to the reactor coolant pump (RCP) 1 [EIIS: AB] seal. Seal injection flow was adjusted and the
low flow alarm for RCP 1 cleared. Operators dispatched auxiliary unit operators (AUOs) to the
field to validate MCR indications. Subsequently, operators received an alarm indicating a
lowering pressurizer level with level indicating 54 percent and slowly lowering. Operators
placed the 1A-A CCP in service and pressurizer level began to recover. At 2230 EDT, on
July 18, 2022, operators declared the 1B-B CCP inoperable and entered Condition A of the
Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.2 for one or more trains
of the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) inoperable.
TS LCO 3.5.2 Condition A has a 72-hour Completion Time (CT) to restore a train(s) to
OPERABLE status. If the train is not restored to OPERABLE within 72 hours, the unit is
required to be in MODE 3 within 6 hours and MODE 4 within 12 hours. Enforcement discretion
of TS LCO 3.5.2 was requested because the estimated time required to troubleshoot, repair,
and test the 1B-B CCP would exceed the 72 hours allowed by Condition A. The request was
granted for a period of 69 hours not to exceed a total time of 141 hours.
At 1635 EDT on July 24, 2022, the 1B-B CCP was declared OPERABLE. Because the
1B-B CCP was inoperable for approximately 138 hours and the unit was not placed in MODE 3
within 78 hours, this constitutes an operation or condition prohibited by TSs and is therefore
being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).
B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event
and contributed to the event:
No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event.

H. Operator actions:
Operators declared the 1B-B CCP inoperable. The 1A-A CCP was started, and pressurizer level
began to return to program level.
I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses:
The 1A-A CCP was manually started in response to the observed plant parameters.
III. Cause of the Event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error:
Disassembly of the 1B-B CCP element showed severe wear on impellers 11 through 6 and less
severe wear on impellers 5 through 1. The wear was on one side (180 degrees around the
circumference) of the impellers. This is indicative of shaft bow. Dye penetrant examination of the
th
shaft showed a crack in the split-ring keeper key groove at the 11 stage impeller. Pending
completion of the destructive analysis, the most likely cause of the failure is low stress, high cycle
fatigue.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause:
There was no identified human performance related root cause.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the Event:
The function of the ECCS is to provide core cooling and negative reactivity to ensure that the
reactor core is protected after any of the following accidents: loss of coolant accident (LOCA),
coolant leakage greater than the capability of the normal charging system; rod ejection accident;
loss of secondary coolant accident, including uncontrolled steam release or loss of feedwater; and
a steam generator tube rupture. The addition of negative reactivity is designed primarily for the loss
of secondary coolant accident where primary cooldown could add enough positive reactivity to
achieve criticality and return to significant power.
The ECCS consists of three separate subsystems: centrifugal charging (high head), safety injection
(SI) (intermediate head), and residual heat removal (RHR) (low head). The ECCS accumulators
and the refueling water storage tank (RWST) are also part of the ECCS. The ECCS flow paths
consist of piping, valves, heat exchangers, and pumps such that water from the RWST can be
injected into the reactor coolant system (RCS) following the accidents described, above. The major
components of each subsystem are the CCPs, the RHR pumps, the RHR heat exchangers, and the
SI pumps. Each of the three subsystems consists of two 100% capacity trains that are
interconnected and redundant such that either train is capable of supplying 100% of the flow
required to mitigate the consequences of an accident.

A probabilistic risk assessment determined the incremental conditional core damage probability for
SQN Unit 1 associated with an additional 5 days of unavailability of the 1B-B CCP was 2.15E-07.
The incremental conditional large early release probability for SQN Unit 1 was 3.05E-09. These
values were below acceptable thresholds and the enforcement discretion granted for an additional
69 hours was acceptable from a risk perspective.
V.(cid:9) Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event. The 1A-A CCP was started,
and pressurizer level began to return to program level.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the
components and systems that failed during the event:
The 1A-A CCP was OPERABLE and placed in service.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident:
The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down.
C.(cid:9) For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service:
The 1B-B CCP was inoperable for approximately 138 hours.
VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP)
under Condition Report 1790511.
A.(cid:9) Immediate Corrective Actions:
The 1B-B CCP element was replaced, testing was completed, and the pump was returned to
service.
B.(cid:9) Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring
in the future:
Corrective actions include implementing preventative maintenance tasks to periodically
replace CCP shafts.
