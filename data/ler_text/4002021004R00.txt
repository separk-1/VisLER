On April 29, 2021, while Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was in Mode 6 for a refueling outage, surveillance
testing identified that the lift setting of pressurizer safety valve (PSV) 1RC-123 was -1.3 percent (%) from its setpoint, which is
outside the Technical Specification (TS) allowed tolerance of +/-1%. The cause of the PSV lift setting being out of tolerance is a
personnel error that resulted in inadvertent installation of a valve that had previously demonstrated setpoint drift incompatible
with TS criteria. The PSV was replaced with another PSV confirmed to have a lift setting within the TS allowed tolerance and no
history of significant drift. The PSV with a history of significant setpoint drift will be retired from service.
The +/-1% TS tolerance is more restrictive than the American Society of Mechanical Engineers code allowed tolerance of +/-3%.
In addition, the safety analysis for the PSVs assumes a PSV tolerance of +/- 3%, so the as-found PSV lift setting of -1.3% is well
within the safety analysis. Therefore, this event had no significance with respect to the health and safety of the public.

NARRATIVE
Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets [].
A. Background
On April 29, 2021, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was in Mode 6 for a refueling outage. A pressurizer
[PZR] safety valve (PSV) [RV] in the reactor coolant system (RCS) [AB] was being tested in accordance with the HNP
Inservice Testing Program. The HNP design has a total of three PSVs. One PSV is scheduled for testing each refueling
outage on a rotating basis. The PSVs were manufactured by Crosby, model HB-BP 86.
On March 30, 2020, it was discovered that the PSV serial number in service for 1RC-123 was the same PSV that was
previously identified with an operating history of being outside of the TS allowed tolerance when tested, based upon an
investigation competed in March 2015. The corrective action to address the PSV’s history of significant setpoint drift was
to retire the PSV from service. The corrective action was not implemented due to a personnel error. The PSV was
inadvertently reinstalled in the 2016 fall refueling outage with an acceptable lift setting. While the potential for drift in the
PSV was recognized in March 2020, it was concluded that the PSV was operable, based upon a review of the installed as-
left lift setting and the historical drift amount observed on this PSV. However, upon testing the PSV’s lift setpoint in the
current refueling outage, it was discovered that the setpoint had drifted further than anticipated. The PSV exhibited
increasing amounts of setpoint drift. The PSV has been removed from service and will be retired.
No other systems, structures or components were inoperable at the time that contributed to the event. This event is
reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as “any operation or condition which was prohibited the plant’s
Technical Specifications,” because there is evidence the PSV lift setting was outside of the tolerance prescribed by TS
prior to discovery.
B. Event Description
1RC-123 was tested on April 29, 2021, and found with a lift setting of -1.3 percent (%) from its setpoint, which is outside
the TS allowed tolerance of +/-1%. A spare PSV was installed in the 1RC-123 location, which was confirmed to be left
within the allowed tolerance of +/-1% and does not have a history of significant setpoint drift. The specific date and time
that the PSV became out of tolerance is not known and cannot be determined. Testing of the PSV is accomplished by
removing the PSV from the system during a refueling outage and having the PSV tested by a vendor. Therefore, the
testing does not cause a system transient. There were no automatically or manually initiated safety system responses due
to the out of tolerance condition identified.
C. Causal Factors
The cause of the PSV lift setting being outside of the TS allowed tolerance is a personnel error that resulted in inadvertent
installation of a PSV that had previously demonstrated a significant amount of setpoint drift. In each of the last five tests,
the PSV failed low with as-found values ranging from -1.09% to -1.45% below the setpoint. The lift setting drift is specific
to the PSV in question and not applicable to the entire population of PSVs.
D. Corrective Actions
The PSV was replaced with another PSV confirmed to have a lift setting within the TS allowed tolerance and no history of
significant setpoint drift. The PSV with an operating history of being outside TS tolerance will be retired from service.

E. Safety Analysis
Premature operation of the PSV could adversely impact departure from nucleate boiling ratio conditions in events such as
the reactor coolant pump [P] seized rotor. The safety analysis for the PSVs assumes a PSV tolerance of +/- 3%, so the as-
found PSV lift setting of -1.3% is well within the safety analysis. Therefore, the reported low opening pressure of 1RC-123
had no significance with respect to the health and safety of the public.
F. Additional Information
HNP Licensee Event Report (LER) 2015-001-00 reported a similar condition, where a PSV lift setting was found outside of
the TS tolerance.
