A pressurizer safety valve (PSV) was removed and tested during the Unit 1 fall 2021 refueling outage (B1 R24) under the
Inservice Testing (1ST) program. The as-found lift setting was outside the Technical Specifications (TS) 3.4.10 and 1ST
program limits. This required the removal and testing of the remaining two PSVs. The remaining two PSVs were also
outside the TS and 1ST program limits.
The three PSVs were replaced during the outage. An engineering analysis on the effects of these valves lifting at the as-
found settings concluded that all acceptance criteria in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15 analyses
are still met.(cid:9) This condition of multiple pressurizer safety valves being outside of their required lift setting tolerance band

NARRATIVE
A. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event:
Event Date:(cid:9) September 19, 2021
Unit: 1(cid:9) MODE: 6 (Refueling) Reactor Power: 000 percent
Unit 1 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB]:(cid:9) Ambient Temperature and Depressurized
No structures, systems or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to the event. The
PSVs were not installed in the system when the condition was discovered.
B. Description of Event:
Energy Industry Identification System (El IS) codes are identified in the text as [XX].
Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10, "Pressurizer Safety Valves" requires three pressurizer [PZR] safety valves
(PSV)(RY) to be operable with lift settings greater than or equal to 2411 psig and less than or equal to 2509 psig.
This lift setting span is based on +/- 2 percent tolerance requirement of a nominal 2460 psig setpoint. TS
Surveillance Requirement 3.4.10.1 requires each pressurizer safety valve (PSV) to be lift tested in accordance with
the Inservice Testing (IST) program. In accordance with the IST Code, expanding the scope of testing is required
for two additional PSVs if a PSV as-found lift pressure exceeds +1- 3 percent of 2460 psig. The 1ST program
requires one PSV to be tested each refueling outage, and it requires the remaining two PSVs to be removed and
tested if the first PSV's as-found lift pressure exceeds the 1ST scope expansion criteria. Byron Station methodology
for testing is to remove the PSV and replace it with an operable PSV and then send the removed PSV to an offsite
testing vendor.
As part of the fall 2021 Unit 1 refueling outage (B1R24) activities, pressurizer safety valve 1RY8010B was removed
and sent to the vendor for testing as required by the IST program. The surveillance as-found acceptance criteria
for PSVs are +/- 1.8 percent of 2460 psig. This is a +/- 2 percent tolerance with an additional restriction of
0.2 percent due to vendor instrumentation uncertainty.
On September 19, 2021, the vendor testing facility informed Byron Station that the 1RY8010B PSV (S/N: N56964-
00-0094) failed the as-found lift pressure test. The as-found lift pressure was 2385 psig, which is outside the
allowed Technical Specification (TS) and Inservice Testing (IST) program limits. In accordance with the 1ST
program, the remaining two installed Unit 1 PSVs were removed and sent to the vendor for testing. On
September 28, 2021, Byron was informed that the 1RY8010A PSV (S/N: N56964-00-0030) failed the as-found lift
pressure test. The as-found lift pressure was 2342 psig, which is outside the allowed TS and 1ST program limits.
On October 1, 2021, Byron was informed that the 1RY8010C PSV (S/N: N56964-00-0090) failed the as-found lift
pressure test. The as-found lift pressure was 2544 psig, which is outside the allowed TS and 1ST program limits.
As the removed valves were replaced with operable valves, no TS action condition applied at the time. However,
the condition of multiple pressurizer safety valves being outside of their required lift setting tolerance band is
reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(b), "Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the
plants Technical Specifications..."

NARRATIVE
C. Cause of Event
The event is documented in station Issue Report (IR) numbers 04447391, 04450104 and 04450108.
The cause of the three PSV as-found lift pressure failures is set pressure drift during system operation. This failure
mechanism aligns with industry operating experience (OPEX). This failure cause has been documented in EPRI
Technical Report, "Nuclear Maintenance Application Center: Safety and Relief Valve Testing and Maintenance
Guide, Revision 2", which describes set-pressure drift in the range of +/- 3 percent to +/- 5 percent where no
mechanical defects or extenuating circumstances can be attributed. The three three PSVs all failed within this
range.
D. Safety Consequences:
The safety significance of this condition was minimal. The pressurizer safety valves provide, in conjunction with the
Reactor Protection System, overpressure protection for the RCS. The safety valves are designed to prevent
system pressure from exceeding the RCS safety limit of 2735 psig.
An engineering analysis on the effects of these valves lifting at the as-found settings concluded that all acceptance
criteria in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15 analyses were still met.
E. Corrective Actions:
The removed PSVs were replaced with operable PSVs.
As part of the investigation into the failure of the PSVs to meet as-found lift pressure acceptance criteria the
recertification process used by the vendor, NWS, was reviewed. Some enhancements were identified to the
vendor valve inspection and recertification process to improve the stability of the lift setpoint pressure and mitigate
potential setpoint drift. The revised valve inspection and recertification process was implemented for use for the
three PSVs discussed in this LER.
The corrective action from the investigation is to review the vendor inspection and certification guidance to ensure
the enhancements have been incorporated.
F. Previous Occurrences:
No previous, similar Licensee Event Reports were identified at the Byron Station in the past three years.
