On August 22, 2023 at 1724 EDT, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the Control Room Operators manually tripped
the reactor due to lowering Main Feed pump suction pressure and Steam Generator water levels. The initiating event was
Heater Drain pump 'B' motor tripping on overcurrent. The cause of the reactor trip was the failure of Condensate pump 'A' to
start automatically or manually. The trip was not complex, and all other systems responded normally post trip. At 1735, the
Control Room was notified of the Heater Drain pump 'B' motor being on fire, and the fire was extinguished by the onsite fire
brigade at 1807. Units 2, 3, and 4 were not affected. The operating crew performed as expected. The unit was stabilized in
Mode 3 with decay heat removed through the Steam Dumps to the Condenser.
The Heater Drain Pump 'B' motor was replaced and the Condensate Pump 'A' differential and lockout relays were replaced.
Due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, this is being reported under 10
CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A).

NARRATIVE
A. Event Description
On August 22, 2023 at 1724 EDT, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the Control Room Operators manually
tripped the reactor due to lowering Main Feed pump (SJ) suction pressure and Steam Generator water levels. The initiating
event was Heater Drain pump 'B' (SN) tripping on overcurrent. The cause of the reactor trip was the failure of Condensate
pump 'A' (SD) to start automatically or manually. The trip was not complex, and all other systems responded normally post
trip. At 1735, the Control Room was notified of the Heater Drain pump 'B' motor being on fire, and the fire was extinguished
by the onsite fire brigade at 1807. Units 2, 3, and 4 were not affected. The operating crew performed as expected. The
unit was stabilized in Mode 3 with decay heat removed through the Steam Dumps (JI) to the Condenser (SG). The
components that failed were the General Electric 5KV84473466501 Heater Drain pump 'B' motor and Basler Electric
G2F-A1P-H1N6F differential relay.
There were no Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that
contributed to the event.
Due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System (JC) and Auxiliary Feedwater System (BA) from the reactor trip, this
issue is reported under 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A).
B. Cause of Event
The initiating event was Heater Drain pump 'B' tripping on overcurrent. The cause of the reactor trip was the failure of
Condensate pump 'A' to start automatically or manually. A failure analysis was performed on Heater Drain pump 'B'.
Results revealed that the failure was due to a surge experienced by the motor, causing a phase-to-phase fault.
Condensate pump 'A' failed to start due to the differential relay being in the tripped position, causing the lockout relay to trip
and preventing breaker closure. Subsequent troubleshooting could not determine the cause of the differential relay being
tripped prior to the pump start demand.
C. Safety Assessment
Heater Drain pump 'B' and Condensate pump 'A' serve no safety-related function for the unit. When the reactor was
manually tripped, all the appropriate safety systems operated as designed, and the operating crew responded as expected.
The Auxiliary Feedwater System actuated as designed and all Control Rods [AA] fully inserted into the core. The event was
within the analysis of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15, and there was no release of radioactivity.
Hence, the safety significance of this issue is very low.
D. Corrective Actions
The corrective actions were replacement of the Heater Drain pump 'B' motor and the differential relay for the Condensate
pump 'A' breaker. Additionally, the lockout relay for Condensate pump 'A' was conservatively replaced.
E. Previous Similar Events
None.
