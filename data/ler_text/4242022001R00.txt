On May 3, 2022 at 15:41 EDT, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the Control Room Operators observed lowering
steam generator water levels and manually tripped the reactor. The lowering steam generator levels were caused by a
malfunction of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system. The trip was not complex, and all systems responded normally post trip.
The Operators stabilized the plant in Mode 3, and decay heat was removed by the steam generators, through the steam dumps
to the condenser. Unit 2 was not affected. The operating crew performed as expected. The Main Feed Pump control system
was repaired and the unit was restarted.
Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of Auxiliary Feedwater (AFVV)
System, this event is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).

NARRATIVE
NARRATIVE
A. Event Description
On May 3, 2022 at 15:41 EDT, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the Control Room Operators observed
lowering steam generator water levels and manually tripped the reactor. The lowering steam generator levels were caused
by a malfunction of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system [JK]. The trip was not complex, and all systems responded
normally post trip. The components that failed were General Electric IS420UCSBH1A control modules.
There were no Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that were out of service at the beginning of the event that
contributed to the event.
Due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS)[JC] and the actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[BA]
System, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).
B. Cause of Event
The cause of the event was a failure of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system which caused the pump to slow down,
resulting in lowering main feedwater flow to the steam generators.
C. Safety Assessment
The Main Feed Pumps [SJ] serve no safety-related function for the unit. When the Operators manually tripped the plant,
all the appropriate safety systems responded as designed. The AFW system actuated as designed and all control rods
[AA] fully inserted into the core. The operating crew performed as expected. The event was within the analysis of the
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15, and there was no release of radioactivity. This event did not pose a
threat to the health and safety of the public, therefore the safety significance of this issue is very low.
D. Corrective Actions
The control system for the Main Feed Pump was repaired.
E. Previous Similar Events
None.
