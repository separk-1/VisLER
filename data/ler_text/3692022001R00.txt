At 2240 [EST] on June 21, 2022, with Unit 1 and Unit 2 operating at approximately 100 percent power and
the A train of the Control Room Area Chilled Water System (CRACWS) inoperable for planned
maintenance, a loss of safety function occurred when the B train CRACWS chiller tripped. A clearance
required for maintenance on the A train was being performed when a non-licensed auxiliary operator (AO)
opened the breaker feeding the oil pump associated with the running and operable B train. This resulted
in an inadvertent trip of the B Chiller. With both CRACWS trains inoperable, Operations entered Abnormal
Procedure AP-39 (Control Room High Temperature) and restored the B train within thirty-five minutes.
The cause of this event is attributed to a human performance error in which the AO did not effectively use
human performance tools to ensure the correct component was identified prior to operation. In addition to
prompt restoration of the B Train of CRACWS and the system's safety function, corrective actions were
initiated to improve accountability of the operator associated with this event, and implementation of
additional layers of defense when placing clearances.
This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public.

NARRATIVE
BACKGROUND
The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER.
Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are enclosed within
brackets.
Control Room Area Chilled Water System [KM]
The purpose of the Control Room Area Chilled Water System (CRACWS) [KM] is to provide chilled water
to the Control Room and Control Room Area Ventilation (CRAVS) [VI] equipment to maintain temperature
within Technical Specification limits.
The CRACWS system has two redundant trains (A and B) serving the CRAVS air handling units providing
cooling of recirculated control room air. The CRACWS operates in conjunction with the CRAVS and are
shared between both McGuire units. These trains are normally not cross-connected. Each CRACWS
train consists of a compression tank to provide water surge protection, a chilled water pump and a control
area chiller. Chilled water circulates in a closed loop. Each chiller has its own separate refrigeration
system. The CRACWS water exchanges heat with the refrigerant in the evaporator to be chilled to a
desired temperature.
The CRACWS is an emergency system which also operates during normal unit operations. A single train
will provide the required temperature control to maintain the control room at approximately 75°F. The
control room is shared between units.

EVENT DESCRIPTION
At 2240 on June 21, 2022, a loss of safety function occurred due to concurrent inoperability of both required
CRACWS trains for 35 minutes. A clearance required for planned maintenance on the A CRACWS chiller was
being performed when a non-licensed operator incorrectly opened the breaker supplying the oil pump
associated with the running and operable B CRACWS Chiller. Prior to opening the incorrect breaker, the A
CRACWS train was declared inoperable due to disconnecting the A CRACWS chiller compressor supply
breaker per the approved clearance. Opening the B CRACWS chiller oil pump breaker resulted in a B
CRACWS chiller trip which was supplying cooling to its required loads.
As a result of the loss of cooling. the control room staff entered Abnormal Procedure AP-39, the incorrectly
opened breaker was reclosed, and the B CRACWS chiller was restarted. The chiller started as expected, and
control room temperatures returned to normal. Engineering data was collected on the B CRACWS chiller, and
all parameters indicated the chiller was functioning properly. The AP was exited after normal operation of the B
CRACWS was confirmed.
Sequence of Events (times are approximate):
• 06/21 20:39, Clearance for the A CRACWS chiller was approved to hang in support of maintenance.
• 06/21 21:24, A CRACWS declared inoperable due to the associated clearance.
• 06/21 22:40, Abnormal Procedure AP-39 was entered due to elevated control room temperature. Unit 1 and
Unit 2 entered the appropriate Technical Specifications.
• 06/21 22:52, The B CRACWS chiller oil pump breaker was reclosed.
• 06/21 23:13, B CRACWS Chiller re-started per the Abnormal Procedure AP-39.
• 06/21 23:15, Unit 1 and Unit 2 exited the Technical Specifications required for two inoperable CRACWS.
• 06/21 23:38, Control room temperatures returned to pre-event conditions and Abnormal Procedure AP-39
was exited.
• 06/22 02:26, 8 Hour Notification made to NRC per 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(v)(D).
REPORTABILITY DETERMINATION
The concurrent inoperability of both trains of CRACWS was initially reported, as required, under 10 CFR
50.72(b)(3)(v)(D), "Any event or condition that at the time of discovery could have prevented the
fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of
an accident."
This LER satisfies the corresponding written reporting criteria in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), "Any event or
condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are
needed to mitigate the consequence of an accident."

CAUSAL FACTORS
A cause investigation was completed for this event. The cause was found to be a non-licensed auxiliary
operator did not use human performance tools effectively to ensure the correct component was identified
prior to operation. A contributing cause was identified as a lack of adequate risk plan development and
implementation by supervisors.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Immediate Actions:
1. Restored power to the B CRACWS Chiller oil pump and restarted the chiller.
Interim and Subsequent Actions:
1. Appropriate accountability and remediation actions performed.
2. Department focus on activities involving clearances that require plant manipulations and associated
procedures including additional layers of defense when placing clearances.
3. Develop and implement training solutions focused on risk recognition and risk plan implementation.
SAFETY ANALYSIS
The safety significance of the CRACWS is low because of the opportunity to mitigate the consequences
of its loss with preplanned measures as described in plant Abnormal Procedures. As a result, the loss of
the CRACWS system, including the chillers, has been screened out of the McGuire PRA as either an
initiating event or as a support system failure. Therefore, the CRACWS has no impact on the calculated
Core Damage Frequency (CDF) or Large Early Release Frequency (LERF) at McGuire. Additionally,
during this event, maximum recorded control room temperature reached 81.4F prior to the restart of the B
CRACWS chiller which is below the Technical Specification required maximum temperature of 90F.
There were no adverse effects on control room instrumentation, controls, or habitability during this event.
Given the above, this event was determined to be of no significance to the health and safety of the public.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
A review of the McGuire corrective action program was conducted to determine if this was a recurring
event (i.e., similar event with the same cause or same failure mode). No previous similar events were
identified within the past three years associated with a loss of safety function due to human error.
Therefore, this is not considered a recurring event.
A review of previous reportable events for the past three years did not identify any additional similar LER
events.
