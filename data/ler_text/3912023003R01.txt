On August 4, 2023 at approximately 1746 Eastern Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), while operating at 100 percent rated
thermal power, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 experienced an automatic reactor trip in response to controls failure
of the main feedwater regulating valve to steam generator 2. All control and shutdown bank rods inserted properly in
response to the reactor trip. All safety systems, including the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System, performed as designed
and there were no complications with the trip.
The root cause of the event was determined to be a vulnerability in the design of the Steam Generator (SG) level
Distributed Control System (DCS) that prevented automatic and manual control of SG Feedwater (FW) inlet flow. The
investigation, at the time of this report, between Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Framatome, and Schneider Electric
has not determined the specific reason for the fault seen at WBN. WBN will be implementing a SG level control strategy
that prevents the total loss of SG inlet flow control.
This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as an automatic actuation of the Reactor
Protection System (RPS) and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW).

I. Plant Operating Conditions before the Event
Watts Bar Unit 2 was at 100 percent Rated Thermal Power (RTP).
II. Description of Event
A. Event Summary
On August 4, 2023 at approximately 1746 Eastern Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), while
operating at 100 percent rated thermal power, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2
experienced an automatic reactor trip in response to a loss of feedwater regulating valve
[EIIS:FCV] control and a subsequent low steam generator (SG)[EIIS:SG] No. 2 level signal. All
control and shutdown bank rods inserted properly in response to the reactor trip. All safety
systems, including the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[EIIS:BA] System, performed as designed
and there were no complications with the trip. After evaluation of all the field test data and
associated field inspections, it was determined that the cause was identified as a failure of
Distributed Controls System (DCS)[EIIS:JB] field bus module (FBM). This failure caused the
main feedwater regulating valve to oscillate open and close resulting in a reactor trip followed
by a turbine trip. The master FBM was removed and the demand signal stabilized when the
system swapped to the tracker FBM. The master and tracker FBM were replaced and sent to
the vendor for failure analysis.
Notification to the NRC of the reactor trip was made by Operations at 2051 EDT (Event
Notification number 56660) in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and
10.50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Auxiliary
Feedwater (AFW) System.
B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the
event and that contributed to the event
There were no safety related inoperable structures, components, or systems that contributed
to this event.

G. The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component
A vulnerability in the design of the SG level DCS can prevent automatic and manual control of
SG FW inlet flow. The specific vulnerability has not been identified. Based on knowledge of
the DCS system, the vulnerability may be hardware or software, so the actual failure mode is
presently unknown.
H. Operator actions
Operations personnel promptly stabilized the plant following the reactor trip.
I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses
The automatic reactor trip was followed by an automatic subsequent turbine trip. Safety
systems responded as expected.
III. Cause of the event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error
The exact cause of the DCS component malfunction is unknown. Manufacturer failure
analysis testing has been ongoing with inconclusive results.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause
No human performance issues were attributed to this event.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the event
While operating at approximately 100 percent power during steady state operation, the Watts Bar Unit 2
reactor experienced an automatic reactor trip at approximately 1746 EDT on August 4, 2023, in
response to the failure of the main feedwater regulating valve control to steam generator number 2.
The sequence of events associated with the trip were bounded by the FSAR Safety Analysis
assumptions. The plant response post-trip was uncomplicated and the plant responded as designed.
Operations entered 2-AOI-16, Loss of Normal Feedwater; 2-E-0, Reactor Trip or Safety Injection and
subsequently transitioned to ES-0.1, Reactor Trip Response and 2-GO-5, Unit Shutdown from 30
percent Reactor Power to Hot Standby.

V.(cid:9) Assessment of Safety Consequences
In review of the associated plant system performance data from the key plant parameters and plant
response to the transient it was concluded that all safety systems performed as designed. There were
no conditions identified where actuation signals were not appropriately generated based on the plant
transient. The parameter response for this automatic reactor trip was bounded by the FSAR safety
analysis assumptions. Probability Risk Assessments (PRA) performed for this Unit 2 trip event resulted
in very small impacts to core damage frequency (CDF) and large early release frequency (LERF)
values.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as
the components and systems that failed during the event
Not applicable.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident
Not applicable.
C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service
Not applicable.
VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
This event was entered into the TVA Corrective Action Program and is being tracked under
Condition Report 1872637.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions
Operations personnel promptly stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Troubleshooting and field
inspections identified a potentially faulty field bus module which was subsequently replaced.

documents a Unit 2 reactor trip that occurred on June 27, 2023. This event was caused by a loose
terminal connection for current input into a generator protection relay.
LER 390-2020-001, “Manual Reactor Trip Due to Lowering Steam Generator Level Caused by a Hand
Station Failure” documents a Unit 1 manual reactor trip that occurred on February 2, 2019. This event
was caused by a stuck pushbutton on the main feedwater regulating valve controller/hand station which
led to a loss of control for steam generator No. 3 level.
