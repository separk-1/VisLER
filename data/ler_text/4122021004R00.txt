At 1007 EST on November 12, 2021, with Unit 2 in Mode 1 at approximately 17 percent power following a refueling outage, the
reactor was manually tripped due to increasing steam generator water levels due to oscillating Main Feedwater Pump
Recirculation Valves. The oscillation of the valves led to a steam generator water level transient that met predefined reactor trip
criteria. The direct cause was the key lock switches for the recirculation valves were left in AUTO allowing the valves to modulate
based on flow indication. The apparent cause was the unit supervisor did not properly read a procedure step from a startup
procedure and the step was not performed.
This is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection
System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1). Corrective actions are procedural clarifications and cautions.

NARRATIVE
Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX].
BACKGROUND
The Main Feedwater Pump Recirculation Valves (2FWR-FCV150A and B) [JB] are each controlled by a CLOSE-AUTO-
OPEN key switch located in the field near the valve. The key switch is normally maintained in AUTO to allow the valves to
be controlled by flow switches in the suction line of the main feed pumps. Red (open) and Green (closed) indicating lights
are provided on Benchboard Section C. The valve will manually open when its local control switch is placed in OPEN and
will manually close when its local control switch is placed in CLOSE.
DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
At 1007 EST on November 12, 2021, the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit 2 (BVPS-2) reactor was manually tripped due
to increasing steam generator [SB] water levels due to 2FWR-FCV150A and B oscillating. The oscillation of the valves led
to a steam generator water level transient that met predefined reactor trip criteria. BVPS-2 was in Mode 1 at approximately
17 percent power following a refueling outage and no equipment was inoperable at the start of the event that contributed
to the event. The trip was not complicated, and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3.
Prior to the event, at approximately 0040, a procedure step to verify that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B
were in OPEN was not performed, resulting in the key lock switches being left in AUTO. Reactor power was then raised
from 5 percent over the next hour and a half to approximately 17 percent by 0200. A condenser steam dump/turbine
bypass valve perturbation caused 2FWR-FCV150A and B to oscillate and then stabilize at approximately 0630. At
approximately 0945 the valves began oscillating again resulting in steam generator water level increase, and the bypass
feedwater regulating valves were placed in manual control to control the steam generator water level. At 1000, the key
lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were placed in OPEN. The steam generator water levels reached the trip criteria
before they were able to be stabilized and the plant was manually tripped at 1007.
CAUSE OF EVENT
On midnight shift during the performance of 2OM-52.4.A, "Raising Power From 5% to Full Load Operation," revision 90, a
step to verify that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were in the OPEN position was not performed
properly, resulting in the key lock switches being left in AUTO. During turbine valve testing on the following shift, a
condenser steam dump [JI] oscillation occurred that led to feedwater flow being lowered to the setpoint of 2FWR-
FCV150A and B which caused the valves to oscillate. These oscillations led to the steam generator water level transient
and subsequent manual reactor trip.
The direct cause was that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were left in AUTO allowing the valves to
modulate based on flow indication.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE OF EVENT (continued)
The apparent cause was during performance of the procedure, the unit supervisor did not properly read step 6 of
2OM-52.4.A to the control room operator and as a result the step was performed incorrectly. The procedure step stated,
"verify failed open," however, the unit supervisor read the step as "verify full open." Additionally, the unit supervisor did not
read two sub steps to take the key lock switch to OPEN. The procedure is also deficient in that these two sub steps do not
contain an action verb to move or verify that the key lock switches are in OPEN.
ANALYSIS OF EVENT
This is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor
Protection System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1). A 4-hour report was made in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)
(B) at 1352 on November 12, 2021 (event notification 55572).
The plant risk associated with the BVPS-2 reactor trip on November 12, 2021, is considered to be very low. This is based
on the change in average core damage frequency derived using the conditional core damage probability and change in
average large early release frequency derived using conditional large early release probability for the event. The safety
significance of this event was very low.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Completed Actions:
The key lock switches were placed in OPEN per 2OM-52.4.A.
An immediate stand down was conducted at the site and within Operations to refocus on the correct behaviors.
Planned Actions:
Procedure 2OM-52.4.A will be updated to add the action verb to step 6 and add a caution prior to the performance of the
step that describes why it is being performed.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
A recent mispositioning event due to personnel not properly following procedure use and adherence requirements
includes Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 1 (BVPS-1) LER 2021-001-00, "Containment Isolation Valve Found
Restrained Open Resulting in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications." The cause and corrective actions from
the BVPS-1 event were related to ensuring that the valves being out of position is logged correctly. This BVPS-2 event
requires a corrective action to clarify a procedure step, and therefore the direct corrective actions for the BVPS-1 event
would not be expected to prevent the BVPS-2 event.
