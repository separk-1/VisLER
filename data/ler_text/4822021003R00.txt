On 5/12/2021, Wolf Creek Generating Station was performing initial reactor startup following Refueling Outage 24 (RF24). With
reactor power at approximately 8%, steam generator levels began to oscillate while in automatic control. Operators took manual
control of the main feedwater regulating bypass valves but were unable to stabilize steam generator levels prior to reaching the
“C” steam generator low level reactor trip setpoint. At 1125 Central Daylight Time (CDT), the reactor tripped and an auxiliary
feedwater actuation occurred. All equipment responded as expected. ENS notification #55252 was made at 1441 CDT in
accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for a specified system actuation.
The cause of the event was determined to be during the 7300 modification, improper utilization of main feedwater regulating
bypass valves inherent valve curves did not take into consideration system flow characteristics. The result was an inaccurate
correlation of feed flow with valve position within the system. This led to a mismatch in feed flow demand and actual feed flow to
the steam generators. Due to improper gain settings, the mismatch began to diverge and led to a reactor trip on low steam
generator water level. Following tuning of control parameters, operators were able to commence reactor startup and reached full
power on 5/15/2021.

PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENTS
The plant was at Mode 1 returning to service following Refueling Outage 24 (RF24) and was at approximately 8% power
when the reactor tripped. No systems, structures, or components (SSCs) were inoperable at the beginning of the event
which contributed to the event.
DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S)
Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes and component codes are identified in the text as [XX].
During Refueling Outage 24 (RF24), the feedwater control system [JB] was upgraded. The newly upgraded system is a
digital based Emerson Ovation System. This system operates in two modes: low-power and high-power. The transition
between the two is based on the measured loop feedwater flow exceeding a predefined threshold. Both control modes
operate the main feed regulating valves (MFRVs) and the MFRV bypass valves [SJ-V], as appropriate. The transition
between the low-power and high-power modes of operation is accomplished automatically. The old system required
manual actions that would demand operator attention, during start up and shutdown.
EVENT DESCRIPTION
At 1125 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on May 12, 2021, Wolf Creek’s reactor tripped in automatic due to low ‘C’ steam
generator [SB-SG] water level. Prior to the reactor trip, Control Room personnel had brought the plant from ~1 percent to
~8 percent power and had entered Mode 1 following RF24. Operators stabilized power at ~8 percent where they intended
to hold for Ovation testing and tuning of the newly installed modification. Although steam generator level control was
initially stable in automatic, operators observed steam generator levels begin to oscillate. Initially, narrow range was most
observable, but it became evident on wide range level as well.
As the oscillations increased and diverged, operators determined they should take manual control of the MFRV bypass
valves to stabilize steam generator levels prior to commencement of control system tuning. Simultaneous with operators
deciding to take manual control, 7300 project personnel and the Westinghouse Ovation engineer were monitoring trends
and had agreed that the MFRV bypass valves should be taken to manual control. Operators placed all four bypass valves
in manual; however, operator actions were unable to stabilize steam generator levels before ‘C’ steam generator level
lowered to 23.5 percent, the low-low steam generator level reactor trip and main feedwater isolation set point. This
resulted in the reactor tripping in automatic and initiating the Main Feedwater Isolation and Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation.
BASIS FOR REPORTABILITY
The reactor trip and actuation of Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) instrumentation actuation
described in this event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), which requires reporting of "Any event or condition that
resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a) (2) (iv) (B) of this section..."
Paragraph (B)(1) of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) includes "Reactor Protection System (RPS) including: reactor scram or reactor
trip." Paragraph (B)(6) of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) includes "PWR auxiliary or emergency feedwater."
ENS notification 55252 was made at 1441 CDT on May 12, 2021, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), which
requires notification within 4 hours, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) which requires notification within 8 hours.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE
The cause was determined to be that during the 7300 modification, improper utilization of MFRV bypass valves inherent
valve curves did not take into consideration system flow characteristics. The result was an inaccurate correlation of feed
flow with valve position within the system. This led to a mismatch in feed flow demand and actual feed flow to the steam
generators. Due to improper gain settings, the mismatch began to diverge and led to a reactor trip on low steam
generator water level.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Immediate actions taken:
• At 1125, Control Room personnel entered EMG E-0, REACTOR TRIP.
• At 1130, the plant exited EMG E-0 and the Control Room transitioned to EMG ES-02, REACTOR TRIP RESPONSE.
• At 1210, Operations commenced GEN 00-005, MINIMUM LOAD TO HOT STANDBY from EMG ES-02.
Actions taken to address the causes:
1) Tuning changes have been made to adjust the bypass valve curve and low power controller gain within the Ovation
controls to provide smoother bypass valve control, decreased steam generator level oscillations, and improve process
control stability.
2) Just-In-Time Training (JITT) was performed with operators prior to starting back up on May 14. Changes made between
the JITT performed for the May 12 and May 14 startup include the following additions:
-Reactor operators were required to each take control of the MFRV bypass valves after a level swing had been started in
a steam generator. They then stopped the steam generator swing.
-Operators performed a manual swap over from the MFRV bypass valves to the MFRVs.
Actions planned:
1) To prevent a change to the feedwater bypass trim characteristics that would alter the tuning, a note is to be added to
the MFRV bypass valve drawing that if the trim parts are changed, the Ovation bypass valve control parameters need to
be reviewed for impact.
2) To address the risk aspect of the root cause, objectives are being added to the new lesson plan for the training for the
digital engineering qualification.

SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE
There were no safety consequences impacting plant or public safety from this event. The operating crew responded
appropriately to lowering steam generator levels. All safety equipment operated appropriately and as designed. There
was no loss of any function that would have prevented fulfillment of actions necessary to: shutdown the reactor and
maintain it in a safe shutdown condition, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident.
OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS EVENTS
LER 2015-003-00 describes an event that occurred at Wolf Creek on May 3, 2015, during startup from RF20.(cid:9) While
swapping feedwater control from the MFRV bypass valves to the MFRVs a high steam generator level was recieved on C
steam generator resulting in a turbine trip, feedwater isolation signal, and eventual reactor trip. This specific event was
caused by a lack of a reliable and consistent standardization between the operating crews to control the transfer of the
steam generator feedwater flow between the MRFV bypass valves and the MFRVs. This previous event is related to the
current occurence as it is associated with steam generator level oscillations during low power ascensions and difficulties
with bypass valve control. However, it is specific to the old analog feedwater control system.
