On June 16, 2023, unit 1 was operating at 100% power. At 18:22, the 1B Main Feedwater Pump (MFP) began indicating
oscillating speed. The oscillations increased in severity and became unresponsive to manual control input. Due to the loss of
control, the 1B MFP was manually tripped as it approached the overspeed setpoints. Following the manual trip of the 1B MFP
the Unit responded with an automatic runback to 700MWe. Following the runback, the combined effects of the entire transient
resulted in an automatic reactor trip due to Steam Generator #4 Lo-Lo water level.
The direct cause of this event was a degraded servo on the 1B MFP. Vendor analysis of the component did not identify a
specific failure mechanism and the cause is inconclusive. Based on engineering evaluation, the most probable cause is
particulate accumulation in the servo valve due to historical water intrusion events into the 1B lube oil system. An additional
supplement will be submitted if further analysis has more conclusive results. Corrective action included replacement of the
servo.
This LER is a supplement to the original LER 23-001-00 submitted on 8/15/2023. All times are in Central Daylight Time (CDT).

I. DESCRIPTION OF REPORTABLE EVENT
A. REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION
This event is reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic
actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section." The systems that actuated were the Unit 1
Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Unit 1 Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW).
B. PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENT
At 18:22 on June 16, 2023, Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant (CPNPP) Unit 1 was in MODE 1 operating at 100%
power.
C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE
EVENT AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT
There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable prior to the event which contributed to the event.
D. NARATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIME
On 6/16/2023 at 18:22 the Balance of Plant Operator identified the 1B Main Feedwater Pump (MFP) began indicating
oscillating speed. The MFPs were taken to manual control mode to stop or minimize the speed oscillations. Due to the
failure of the 1B Servo, the oscillations were not reduced, and the speed control was taken back to Automatic. As a result
of the 1B MFP oscillations, the Steam Generator levels fell -5%, then operations tripped the 1B MFP, at 18:30. The Unit
responded with an automatic runback to 700MWe. Following the 1B trip, the 1A MFP continued to increase speed to
follow the feedwater reference signal and was able to stabilize steam generator level for a period of time prior to the
steam pressure dropping due to the steam dumps opening. The 1A MFP was able to increase the Feedwater flow to the
Steam Generators and stabilize the Steam Generator (SG) water levels. SG 1-01 and SG 1-03 stabilized around 50%
while SG 1-02 and 1-04 showed signs of stabilizing just under 40% as FW Flow and 1A MFP speed increased. Due to the
decrease in steam pressure and the SG water levels when 1B was tripped (62% vs 67%), the 1A MFP was not able to
pick up enough load to recover from the low Steam Generator Water Level before the SG 1-04 Water Level LO-LO (38%)
trip set point was reached and the reactor automatically tripped at 18:32.

II. COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURES
A. CAUSE OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE
The cause of this event was a failure of the 1B MFP servo [IEEE: (JK)(PSV)]. Initial vendor analysis did not identify any
specific failure mechanism of the component. Engineering evaluation of the failure determined the most probable cause
to be historical water intrusion events into the 1B lube oil system resulting in a loss of valve stroke due to rust/particulate
blocking the servo valve oil passages. This condition limited the ability of the LP (low pressure) control Valves to regulate
steam and control the Turbine speed.
B. FAILURE MODE, MECHANISM, AND EFFECTS OF EACH FAILED COMPONENT
This event was first identified by operations as speed oscillations on the 1B MFP. The MFP was manually tripped when
oscillations could not be adequately controlled. Due to the oscillations and decreasing steam generator level, the reactor
automatically tripped on Steam Generator 1-04 low level (38%).
C. SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY FAILURE OF COMPONENTS WITH
MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS
This event did not involve systems or secondary functions which were affected by the 1B MFP servo failure.
D. FAILED COMPONENT INFORMATION
The MFP Servos (General Electric 134B433AB-1) are part of the speed control system for the Main Feed Pump Turbine
(MFPT). These Servos are replaced every 18 months as part of the preventative maintenance program. The most recent
replacement occurred on 5/15/2022 during 1RF22.
III. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT
A. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES THAT OCCURRED
The Reactor Protection System and Auxiliary Feedwater System started as designed due to low-low steam generator
water level following the trip.
B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM TRAIN INOPERABILITY
This event did not involve the inoperability of any safety component or system.

C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT
A turbine trip is an ANS Condition II event (Faults of Moderate Frequency). When the reactor was automatically tripped
the Auxiliary Feedwater System started to provide feedwater to the steam generators. The reactor trip on lo-lo water level
in any steam generator provides the necessary protection against a loss of normal feedwater.
An automatic reactor trip was exercised and the Auxiliary Feedwater System started automatically as expected and all
plant safety systems responded as designed during the resultant transient. This event had no impact on nuclear safety,
reactor safety, radiological safety, environmental safety or the safety of the public. This event has been evaluated as not
meeting the definition of a safety system functional failure per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v).
IV. CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The direct cause of this event was a degraded servo on the 1B MFP. Vendor analysis of the component failure was
inconclusive. Engineering evaluation of the failure determined the most probable cause to be historical water intrusion
events into the 1B lube oil system. This caused particulate accumulation in the servo valve and limited the ability of the
LP control valves to regulate steam and control turbine speed.
V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Corrective actions include replacement of the 1B MFP servo and increased monitoring of speed oscillations.
VI. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
There have been no previous similar reportable events at CPNPP in the past three years.
