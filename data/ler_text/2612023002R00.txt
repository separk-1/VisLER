At 10:35 hours Eastern Daylight Time on 06/22/2023, with Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100% power, H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant,
Unit 2 (HBRSEP2), experienced an automatic turbine trip followed by an automatic reactor trip during the performance of reactor
protection logic testing. Subsequent to the reactor trip, the auxiliary feedwater system actuated as expected on low steam
generator level. There were no other equipment performance issues.
The cause of this event is attributed to pre-existing flaws with reactor trip breaker cubicle design that allowed for the flexing of the
cell switch support structure, which resulted in the failure of the cell switch to change state and preclude a turbine trip or reactor
trip when the 'B' reactor trip bypass breaker was racked in to position during testing. The trip was not complex, with all systems
responding normally.
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the event resulting in an automatic actuation of the reactor
protection system and auxiliary feedwater system. This event did not impact the health and safety of the public.

BACKGROUND
At the time of this event, H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2, (HBRSEP2) was operating in Mode 1 at
approximately 100 percent power. No structures, systems, or components were out of service at the time of this event that
contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the
reactor protection system (RPS) [AA] and auxiliary feedwater system (AFW) [BA].
The RPS monitors all parameters related to the safe operation of the reactor. The system is designed to protect the core
against fuel rod cladding damage caused by departure from nucleate boiling, and to protect the reactor coolant system
[AB] against damage caused by overpressure.
HBRSEP2 reactor trip breakers (RTBs) and reactor trip bypass breakers (BYBs) are DB-50 breakers originally supplied
from Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Cell switches are designed to externally indicate the change of state as a
breaker moves from the CONNECT position to the TEST position and vice versa within the cell compartment. The
switches are designed to mount on a channel at the bottom rear of the breaker compartment. Each switch contains eight
switch contacts.
On 06/22/2023 at 13:50 hours Eastern Daylight Time, Event Notification Report #56585 was made to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) Operations Center under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), due to the automatic actuation of the
RPS, and under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A)(B)(6), due to the valid actuation of the AFW system. This criterion requires a
licensee event report (LER) be submitted within 60-days of the event date.
EVENT DESCRIPTION
At 10:35 hours on 06/22/2023, an automatic turbine [TRB] trip and a subsequent automatic reactor [RCT] trip occurred.
Subsequent to the reactor trip, the auxiliary feedwater system actuated as expected on low steam generator level.
Maintenance and operations personnel were performing at-power reactor protection logic train 'B' testing. Per the test
procedure, the 'B' reactor trip bypass breaker [BKR] was racked in and closed to permit the testing of the 'B' reactor trip
breaker. This action should have caused the cell switch [33] contact (52H) for the 'B' reactor trip bypass breaker to open
to allow testing and prevent the logic necessary for a turbine control system-actuated [TG] turbine trip signal. However,
due to flexure in the breaker cell switch mounting support [SPT] the cell switch experienced enough displacement as the
bypass breaker was racked into position to cause the switch to remain closed. The result was generation of a turbine trip
signal to the turbine control system. subsequent turbine trip, reactor trip and auxiliary feedwater system actuation when
the 'B' RTB was opened for testing.
CAUSAL FACTORS
An in-depth evaluation of the automatic turbine trip followed by the automatic reactor trip has concluded that the direct
cause of the turbine trip signal was a design characteristic of the cubicle design that allowed for the flexing of the cell
switch support structure, which resulted in the failure of the switch to change state and prevent a turbine trip and reactor
trip. An extent of condition review was performed on the remaining reactor trip breakers and bypass breaker. The same
design vulnerability was determined to exist on the 'B' reactor trip breaker, requiring additional support shims be installed.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
An engineering change was implemented to install support shims beneath the breaker cell switches of the subject reactor
trip and bypass breakers to correct the condition and prevent recurrence. Procedure changes to Reactor Protection Logic
Train Testing At-Power maintenance test procedures have been initiated to utilize turbine control system sliding links
eliminating trips due to cell switch contact failure during testing. Any changes to the corrective actions or completion
schedules will be made in accordance with the site's corrective action program.
SAFETY ANALYSIS
The reactor was operating at full power during the Reactor Protection Logic Train 'B' At Power Testing when an automatic
reactor trip occurred. The mitigating equipment (RPS and AFVV) functioned as expected and plant shutdown proceeded
normally without further challenge. The cause of the plant trip is attributed to a design characteristic of the cubicle design
that allowed for the flexing of the breaker cell switch support structure, which resulted in the failure of the switch to change
state. The RPS trip logic performed as designed and there were no other equipment performance issues. Therefore, this
event had very low safety significance based on a successful reactor trip with no equipment or operational challenges.
This event resulted in no impact to the health and safety of the public.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
An operating experience search was conducted and there are no prior events at HBRSEP2 involving inadvertent actuation
of the reactor protection system due to reactor trip bypass breaker cell switch malfunction within the past five years.
Energy Industry Identification System (El IS) codes for systems and components relevant to this event are identified in the
text of this document within brackets [ ].
