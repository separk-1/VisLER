On September 11, 2023, at 1558 hours with Unit 2 in Mode 5 at 140 degrees F and 30 psig for a refueling outage, a boric acid
leak was discovered on tubing associated with a Pressurizer level transmitter. The leak was not quantifiable as it consisted of a
small amount of dry boric acid. Non-destructive examination (NDE) was performed on the leak to determine if it was a through
wall leak. On October 3, 2023, at 1154 with Unit 2 in Mode 6 at 100 degrees F and atmospheric pressure, the NDE determined
the leak was a through wall leak. This failure constitutes welding or material defects in the primary coolant system that cannot
be found acceptable under ASME Section Xl. Therefore, an 8-hour report was made for a degraded condition under 10 CFR
50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A).
The direct cause of the weld failure was due to inadequate welding process control by the welder. Unit 1 was not impacted by
this event. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.

NARRATIVE
1.0 Description of Event
On September 11, 2023, at 1558 hours with Unit 2 in Mode 5 at 140 degrees F and 30 psig for a refueling outage, a boric
acid leak was discovered on tubing associated with a Pressurizer (EIIS Component PZR, System AB) level transmitter (EIIS
Component LT, System AB). The leak was not quantifiable as it consisted of a small amount of dry boric acid.
Non-destructive examination (NDE) was performed on the leak to determine if it was a through wall leak. On October 3,
2023, at 1154 with Unit 2 in Mode 6 at 100 degrees F and atmospheric pressure, the NDE determined the leak was a
through wall leak. This failure constituted welding or material defects in the primary coolant system that cannot be found
acceptable under ASME Section Xl. Therefore, an 8-hour report was made for a degraded condition under 10 CFR 50.72(b)
(3)(ii)(A). This weld was part of an instrument tubing design change that was implemented in 1998.
2.0 Significant Safety Consequences and Implications
No significant safety consequences resulted from this event. The leak was discovered while Unit 2 was shut down for a
refueling outage. The leak was not quantifiable based on the small amount of boric acid noted and, therefore, well within the
capability of one charging pump (EIIS Component P, System CB). The health and safety of the public were not affected by
this event.
3.0 Cause of the Event
The direct cause of the weld failure was due to inadequate welding process control by the welder. The specific socket welds
in question exhibited poor workmanship by having a large degree of melt-through and suck-back on the inside surface, and
multiple arc strikes and excessive grinding on the outside surface. During the metallurgical failure analysis, the sample was
sectioned through the area of suspected leakage, which revealed a lack of fusion defect between the weldment and base
metal. The degree of lack of fusion confirmed in the laboratory analysis was substantial enough to provide the eventual leak
path after a 25-year service period.
4.0 Immediate Corrective Action
Both the leaking socket welded coupling and a non-leaking downstream socket welded coupling were replaced. NDE
surface examinations were performed on the replacement socket welds, and the area was also examined during an
external leakage check.
5.0 Additional Corrective Actions
Additional Liquid Penetrant (LP) exams were performed on tubing welds from the pressurizer steam space to a different
Pressurizer level transmitter. No weld flaws or boric acid residue was identified during these examinations. For the next
refueling outages for each unit, work orders have been created to inspect tubing socket welds that were fabricated in a
similar timeframe, under similar field conditions, using the same welding and inspection procedures, and had an overlap of
qualified welders performing the work.
