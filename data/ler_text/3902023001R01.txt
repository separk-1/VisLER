On May 3, 2023, while starting up from a refueling outage, an NRC inspector questioned compliance for Watts Bar
Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 1 being in Mode 5 with 53 of 54 Reactor Vessel head closure bolts fully tensioned, which
NRC determined was not in compliance with Technical Specification (TS) Table 1.1-1. Following review of this
issue within WBN and NRC management, WBN Unit 1 was returned to Mode 6 on May 4, 2023 at 0237 Eastern
Daylight Time (EDT). Investigation shows the WBN Unit 1 had operated with only 53 reactor vessel head closure
bolts fully tensioned for Cycles 17 and 18 due to a damaged reactor head closure stud hole, which represents a
condition prohibited by TS.
This event was the result of an inadequate 10 CFR 50.59 screening associated with the temporary modification for
allowing WBN to operate with one reactor vessel closure stud out of service. The conclusion of this 50.59 screening
determined, incorrectly, that the proposed activity did not require a TS amendment and prior NRC approval.
Immediate corrective actions included the submittal and the receipt of a TS amendment allowing operation of WBN
Unit 1 with 53 reactor head closure bolts for one cycle. A permanent license amendment request was submitted to
the NRC and training will be provided to 50.59 qualified individuals and operations personnel at WBN on this event.

NARRATIVE
III. Cause of the event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error
No component or system failure or personnel error was involved.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause
The cause of the event was personnel incorrectly performing a 50.59 screening which
concluded that the proposed activity did not require a change to the TS and prior NRC
approval was not needed.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the event
During the Spring 2016 refueling outage on WBN Unit 1, difficulty was encountered while
attempting to remove the reactor vessel closure bolt at Location number 34. The reactor vessel is
a component within the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [EIIS:AB]. The bolt was eventually
removed, but visual inspection of the bolt determined there was damage to the lower portion of
the threads. Inspection of the bolt hole at the end of the outage determined the threads were
potentially damaged and would require significant planning and equipment mobilization to repair.
The site elected to perform a temporary modification to operate with one bolt removed. An
Engineering evaluation and 10 CFR 50.59 screening concluded that operation with one bolt
removed was acceptable and no change to the TS was needed. This 10 CFR 50.59 screening
was subsequently determined to be incorrect due to failure to fully comply with TS Table 1.1-1.
V.(cid:9) Assessment of Safety Consequences
Operation with 53 reactor head bolts fully tensioned has been determined to be acceptable by
engineering analysis.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as
the components and systems that failed during the event
No components failed as a result of this issue.
