On May 2, 2023, at 0423 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 14 percent power, during
startup testing, the reactor was manually tripped due to loss of feedwater flow. The loss of feedwater was due to high
differential pressure across the main feedwater pump suction strainers, which was caused by a secondary plant transient. The
secondary plant transient was caused by shipping flanges which had remained installed in the condensate flowpath. The
operators responded to ensure plant stability, with decay heat removal by discharging steam to the main condenser using the
steam dumps and startup feedwater supplying the steam generators. The corrective actions for this event included removal of
the shipping flanges, inspection and cleaning of Main Feedwater Pump suction strainers, and repair of the feedwater heater
drain cooler bypass valve that failed due to an increased cycling frequency from blockage of the condensate normal drain path.
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). VEGP
Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On May 2, 2023, at 0423 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 14 percent power, during
startup testing, the reactor was manually tripped. The initiating event was automatic isolation of three feedwater heater
[EIIS: SM / HX] strings due to high level in low-pressure feedwater heaters and a subsequent manual trip of the main
turbine [EIIS: TA / TRB] from 75 percent power. Following the turbine trip, high differential pressure was observed across
the suction strainers [EIIS: SJ / STR] of all three main feedwater pumps [ENS: SJ / P], requiring a manual reactor trip due to
loss of all feedwater flow as a result of this secondary plant transient. The reactor power was at 14 percent when the
Reactor Protection System (RPS) was manually actuated. There were no structures, systems, or components that were
inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in manual actuation of the RPS.
EVENT ANALYSIS
The cause leading to the manual RPS actuation was blockage of the normal drain paths from drain coolers by the shipping
flanges in the condenser flashbox nozzles, which was a legacy construction issue. With the shipping flanges in place, the
normal drain paths from the low pressure drain tanks [EIIS: SM / TK] to the condensers [EIIS: SG / COND] were not
effective, resulting in more frequent cycling of the feedwater heater drain cooler bypass air-operated valves [EIIS: SM / LCV]
to compensate for the blocking of the heater drain system normal drain paths to the condensers through the feedwater
heater drain coolers. This resulted in a failure of the feedwater heater drain cooler bypass air-operated valve 3-HDS-V021B
[EIIS: SM / LCV], which initiated the feedwater heater string isolations, requiring the operators to initiate a manual turbine
trip. The dynamic forces from the turbine trip from 75 percent power caused solids that had accumulated in the secondary
systems to become loose and drawn into the suction strainers for the main feedwater pumps, reducing flow to the steam
generators and reducing steam generator inventory. The reactor trip was manually actuated due to loss of feedwater flow.
SAFETY ASSESSMENT
There were no safety consequences due to this event because the manual actuation of the RPS maintained the plant in a
safe condition. The operators responded timely by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by discharging
steam to the main condenser [EIIS: SG / COND] using the steam dump valves [EIIS: SB / PCV] and supplying the steam
generators [EIIS: SB / SG] using the startup feedwater pumps [EIIS: SJ / P]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a
result of the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• Inspected heater drain system piping and removed blind flanges from drain cooler A, B, and C to the condenser outlet
piping
• Repaired the feedwater heater drain cooler bypass air-operated valve 3-HDS-021B
• Inspected and cleaned the main feedwater pump suction strainers
