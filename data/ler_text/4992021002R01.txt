On October 15, 2021, at 0133 hours, the South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC) started High
Head Safety Injection (HHSI) Pump 2B for SI Accumulator 2B fill. Neither the HHSI pump room fans nor the
containment sump isolation valve cubicle fans auto started as expected. The B-Train Emergency Core Cooling System
(ECCS) and Containment Spray were declared inoperable. On October 15, 2021, at 1319 hours, troubleshooting
commenced and determined the cause for the failure was the B-Train hand switch (B2HFHS9527) was sticking and
needed to be replaced. On October 15, 2021, at 2318 hours, Operations declared B-Train ECCS and Containment Spray
operable following completion of corrective maintenance.
On October 27, 2021, at 2058 hours the event was determined to be reportable by Operations as a condition prohibited
by Technical Specifications because the required action statements for Technical Specifications 3.5.2 and 3.6.2.1 were
not met.
A planned corrective action resulting from this event is to improve the process of requiring retention of defective
components. Completed corrective actions resulting from this event include the replacement of the B train hand switch,
evaluation of operating experience against the risk of de-terming and re-terming the hand switch given its proximity to
other switches, and inspection of four other hand switches to determine effectiveness of current PMs.

NARRATIVE
I. Description of Reportable Event
A. Reportable event classification
This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because the South Texas Project (STP)
Technical Specification 3.5.2 required action statements for an inoperable Essential Core Cooling
System (ECCS) and Technical Specification 3.6.2.1 required action statements for an inoperable
Containment Spray System were not met.
B. Plant operating conditions prior to event
Prior to the event, STP Unit 2 was at 100% power in Mode 1.
C. Status of structures, systems, and components that were inoperable at the start of the event and that
contributed to the event
No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to
this event.
D. Background Information
Unit 2 Control Room hand switch (B2HFHS9527), hereafter referred to as the B-Train hand switch, can
be operated to turn on the fans that provide cooling for the B-Train Safety Injection (SI) Pump and
Containment Spray (CS) Pump cubicles. The B-Train hand switch failed which prevented the cooling
fans in air handling units VAH-005 and VAH-013 from starting automatically as designed when High
Head Safety Injection (HHSI) Pump 2B was started for testing.
The B-Train hand switch is a General Electric SBM rotary control hand switch, which are used widely
throughout industry and at South Texas Project Electric Generating Station (STPEGS). This B-Train
hand switch is designed with a manual start position which can start the SI pump valve room VAH-005
fan from the control room, a STOP position to secure the fan, a pull-to-lock position to completely
deenergize power to the fans for personal safety and for maintenance, and an AUTO position that allows
the cooling fans to start automatically when HHSI Pump 2B is started. Once the fan motors are started,
they continue to run until an operator manually stops the fans with the B-Train hand switch. The status of
the fans (on/off) can be confirmed in the Control Room by computer point readout.
The function of the VAH-005 and VAH-013 supplemental cooler units is to provide cooling in Fuel
Handling Building (FHB) Room 005 and FHB Room 008 which contain the B-Train SI pumps and the
Containment Spray Pump. Elevated temperatures in these rooms are detected by thermostats and the
VAH-005 and VAH-013 fans are designed to start automatically on high temperature. The fan startup
circuits are also interlocked with the startup and running of any one of the pumps in the room.
The FHB Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) System maintains the normal
environmental conditions required to ensure the operability of the system components that are located
inside the Fuel Handling Building. During normal operation, the supply air subsystem provides the
building with a filtered source of outside air at the proper temperature. Cooling coils supplied by the

non-safety Mechanical Auxiliary Building chilled water subsystem provide adequate cooling capacity to
maintain the building within design ambient temperatures. Similarly, electric heating coils provide
adequate heating capacity to temper outside supply air during winter conditions. Upon an engineered
safety features (ESF) actuation for safety injection, high radiation, or loss of offsite power, the supply air
subsystem is shut down. Emergency air relief dampers are opened to continue to permit outside air into
the building. During the ESF mode of operation, the safety-related exhaust air subsystem continues to
draw outside air into the building through the relief dampers. The exhaust air subsystem pulls air through
return air registers in the cubicles and exhaust ventilation ducts to exit through the plant main vent stack.
FHB HVAC is a required support system for the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) and the
containment spray system.
E.(cid:9) Narrative summary of the event

October 27, 2021, 20:58 hours: Event was determined to be reportable by Operations as a condition
prohibited by Technical Specifications.
F.(cid:9) Method of discovery
The event was self-revealed when the VAH-005 and VAH-013 fans failed to start when HHSI pump 2B
was started for testing.
Engineering evaluation concluded there was firm evidence that the B-Train hand switch failure occurred
on October 5, 2021 when the switch was manipulated to stop the VAH-005 fans. The failure of the
B-Train hand switch prevented cooling fans VAH-005 and VAH-013 from performing their safety
function of heat removal from October 5, 2021 to October 15, 2021, resulting in conditions prohibited by
Technical Specifications for exceeding the seven-day allowed outage times for ECCS Technical
Specifications 3.5.2 Limiting Condition for Operation Action (a) and the Containment Spray System
Technical Specification 3.6.2.1 Limiting Condition for Operation Action (a).
II. Component failures
A. Failure Mode, mechanism, and effects of failed component
The failed component in this event was B-Train hand switch (B2HFHS9527). This hand switch is a
General Electric rotary SBM control switch located in the Control Room. This model of hand switches is
a rugged design with proven reliability, but they can develop high contact resistance that in rare instances
can prevent relay actuations.
Troubleshooting determined that the B-Train hand switch was sticking, as reported by Maintenance
personnel during switch replacement. Prior to replacement of the switch, Operations manipulated the
switch to the start position and the fans came on at that time, indicating a potential intermittent failure of
the switch. The most likely cause of the switch was sticking of the switch and/or high resistance contacts
inside the switch.
The failure of the B-Train hand switch resulted in the cooling fans VAH-005 and VAH-013 not
automatically starting to provide heat load removal for the B-Train HHSI pump, Low Head Safety
Injection (LHSI) pump, and Containment Spray Pump should these pumps be called upon to perform
their safety functions during the time window from October 5, 2021 to October 15, 2021. This time
frame exceeds the seven-day allowed outage time of the ECCS Technical Specification 3.5.2 Limiting
Condition for Operations Action (a) and the seven-day allowed outage time of the Containment Spray
System Technical Specification 3.6.2.1 Limiting Condition for Operations Action (a).
B. Cause of component or system failure or personnel error
The direct cause of this event was the failure of B-Train hand switch B2HFHS9527 which resulted in
cooling fans VAH-005 and VAH-013 failing to start automatically to provide supplemental heat load
removal in the rooms containing the B-Train HHSI pump, LHSI pump, and Containment Spray Pump.
The failure of the hand switch was due to a sticking hand switch or due to a high resistance contact in the
switch. The failed switch was not retained for more detailed failure analysis, but the personnel who

performed the replacement activity reported it was sticking when operating. Additionally, prior to
replacement of the B-Train hand switch, Operations manipulated the switch to the start position and the
fans started, indicating a potential intermittent failure of the switch.
Engineering evaluation concluded that there is firm evidence that the B-Train hand switch failed when
Operations used it to stop the VAH-005 fans, in accordance with procedure. Although the fans are started
automatically, to stop the VAH-005 fans after a start due to any cause other than high room temperature,
the operator must take the hand switch from the AUTO position to the STOP position. The hand switch
should have spring-returned to center, which is the AUTO position. The switch contact would not be
expected to go from being closed to open without some external event occurring, therefore South Texas
Project Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC) concluded the component failure occurred when the
spring returned to center when VAH-005 was stopped on October 5, 2021.
C. Systems or secondary functions that were affected by the failure of components with multiple functions
This event involved a failure in the B-Train supplemental coolers portion of the Fuel Handling Building
HVAC system, resulting in the B-Train Safety Injection System and the B-Train Containment Spray
System being declared inoperable. The dependency of B-Train Safety Injection and B-Train Containment
Spray on FHB HVAC supplemental coolers is an expected consequence of the approved STPEGS
design. No other systems were directly affected.
D. Failed component information
The B-Train hand switch was a General Electric SBM control switch model Q16SBMC4A42S1F1P1.
This model control switch is a four-position, three-stage, with spring return to the central position,
Pull-to-Lock capability, and a pistol hand grip. General Electric SBM rotary switches are used widely in
the industry and at STPEGS in many applications; most of these are in the Control Board of the Control
Room and in Switchgear of the Power Distribution System. They are a rugged design with proven
reliability, but they can develop high contact resistance that in rare instances can prevent relay actuations.
III. Analysis of the event
A. Safety system responses that occurred
No safety system responses occurred due to this event.
B. Duration of safety system inoperability
The Unit 2 B-Train LHSI, HHSI, and Containment Spray systems were inoperable from October 5, 2021
at 0348 hours until October 15, 2021 at 2318 hours.
C. Safety consequences and implications
Supplemental cooler VAH-005 provides cooling for continued operation of the LHSI Pump 2B, HHSI
Pump 2B, and Containment Spray Pump 2B motors, so it is considered required auxiliary equipment to
support the B-Train of the ECCS and Containment Spray System. These systems were declared
inoperable from October 5, 2021 through October 15, 2021 due to the inability to provide sufficient

HVAC heat removal.
This ten-day period exceeds the seven-day allowed outage time of the ECCS Technical Specification
3.5.2 Limiting Condition for Operations Action (a) and the seven-day allowed outage time of the
Containment Spray System Technical Specification 3.6.2.1 Limiting Condition for Operations Action
(a).
The period of inoperability for ECCS B-Train and Containment Spray B-Train is based on the
supplemental cooler VAH-005 not providing cooling for continued operation of the LHSI Pump 2B,
HHSI Pump 2B, and Containment Spray Pump 2B motors. These pumps were available to start
automatically with an ESF signal and would have started successfully and provided their design flow
rates. During the ESF mode of operation, the safety-related Fuel Handling Building exhaust air
subsystem continues to draw outside air into the building through the relief dampers. The exhaust air
subsystem pulls air through return air registers in the cubicles and exhaust ventilation ducts to exit
through the plant main vent stack. The exhaust air fans will draw air from the lower elevations of the
Fuel Handling Building, and eventually outside air, to the B-Train Safety Injection and Containment
Spray pump room. This air flow will be available for some heat removal from the pump room.
Due to the condition with the B-Train hand switch, the VAH-005 and VAH-013 fans would not have
started with an ESF actuation through the breaker closed contacts for the LHSI Pump 2B, HHSI Pump
2B, or Containment Spray Pump 2B. VAH-005 would also not have started on high room temperature.
The valve room supplemental cooler VAH-013 would have started automatically if high room
temperature was sensed by the thermostat in the valve room (FHB Room 008) and would have provided
its design capacity for heat removal with essential chilled water. The high temperature start of VAH-013
is independent of the control circuit VAH-005.
Considering the size of the B-Train Safety Injection and Containment Spray pump room, the cooling
provided air drawn to the exhaust air subsystem, and the availability of supplemental cooler VAH-013 to
start on valve room high temperature, engineering judgement indicates the LHSI Pump 2B, HHSI Pump
2B, and Containment Spray Pump 2B motors could have continued to operate successfully if called
upon. The failure of the B-Train hand switch (B2HFHS9527) did not significantly compromise plant
safety.
IV. Cause of the event
The most-likely cause of the event was due to a sticking hand switch or due to a high resistance contact
in the switch. The failed switch was not retained for more detailed failure analysis.
V. Corrective actions
As a corrective action, the sticking B-Train hand switch was replaced, and a post-maintenance test was
successfully performed on October 15, 2021.
STPNOC plans to improve the process of requiring retention of components for further analysis after
they are removed following an unexpected failure. This corrective action is being tracked in the CR
database and is due to be complete August 31, 2022.

STPNOC evaluated industry operating experience and determined that the best solution would be to
follow the industry recommendation for cycling the hand switches to verify operability. STPNOC
concluded that the other industry recommendation for de-terming and re-terming the hand switches to
inspect them for developing issues presented too high of a plant status control risk due to the proximity
of other switches on the control board.
STPNOC inspected four other SBM hand switches at the station to determine the material conditions and
evaluate if the preventative maintenance strategies need to be revised. All four switches were found to
have no discrepancies, clean contacts, and operated smoothly without sticking. The results were
evaluated and STPNOC determined that the current preventative maintenance frequency and scope are
sufficient. Therefore, the corrective action to increase the frequency of the preventative maintenance
from 468 weeks to 234 weeks was canceled. As an alternate solution, system engineers will continue to
monitor the condition of the hand switches, and if a trend is identified will generate corrective actions.
VI. Previous similar events
General Electric SBM rotary switches are used widely in the industry and at STPEGS in many
applications; most of these are in the Control Board of the Control Room and in the Switchgear of the
Power Distribution System. They are a rugged design with proven reliability, but STP experience shows
they can develop high contact resistance that in rare instances can prevent relay actuations.
Since the SI and Containment Spray pumps are rarely energized, GE SBM series control room hand
switches are not exercised frequently. This can lead to contamination buildup on the contacts or binding
in the switch mechanism and develop high contact resistance that in rare instances can prevent relay
actuations.
A similar event occurred at STPEGS in 2007. In this similar event, the Unit 1 A-Train fans VAH-004
and VAH-012 failed to start following a start of LHSI Pump. This failure was attributed to high contact
resistance of the associated A-Train hand switch (A1HFHS9517). As a corrective action for this event,
STPNOC created preventive maintenance activities to cycle the hand switches to remove contact
oxidation and exercise the switch. These actions have proved effective in preventing additional similar
events since 2007.
Additionally, there is also industry experience with defective internal cam followers and worn, dirty, or
broken contacts that can prevent switch actuation found in a report prepared by Power Technical
Associates, Inc., โGeneric Qualification of Rotary Hand Switches,โ May 1983. The defective cam
followers were the result of some of the cam followers being exposed to hydrocarbons during
manufacturing. The hydrocarbons would cause the cam followers to degrade as they were made of
polycarbonate. As a result, maintenance procedures were revised to prohibit the use of hydrocarbons as a
cleaner. Industry operating experience has also found multiple instances of failed actuation being caused
by tarnished, dirty, or loose contacts.
Additional recent industry guidance can be found in a special inspection report, ML21321A365, that
describes a General Electric type SBM control switch that failed to actuate. When examined the switch
was found to have fouling on the contacts that prevented the current flow necessary to actuate the
