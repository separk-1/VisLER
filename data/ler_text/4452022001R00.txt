On September 05, 2022, Unit 1 was operating at approximately 100% power. At 2345, a spurious failure of the channel 1 shaft
displacement signal coupled with a previous failure of the channel 2 shaft displacement signal caused a trip of the Unit 1 turbine
through the turbine trip logic. This led to a Unit 1 reactor trip due to a turbine trip with reactor power greater than 50%. Entry into
the Emergency Plan was not required.
The cause of this event was the spurious, momentary failure of the channel 1 main turbine shaft displacement signal coupled
with the complete failure of the channel 2 main turbine shaft displacement signal. These excessive displacement signals satisfied
the shaft displacement trip logic for the turbine. The cause of the signal failures was determined to be inadequate protection of
the shaft displacement probe cabling against chafing. Corrective actions include replacement of all three channels of shaft
probes, cables, and drivers, as well as defeating the shaft displacement trip through the next refueling outage. Additional
corrective actions included revising the shaft displacement probe installation instructions and developing permanent
modifications for the routing of the turbine shaft displacement probes for implementation during the next refueling outage.
All times are in Central Daylight Time (CDT).

NARRATIVE
I. DESCRIPTION OF REPORTABLE EVENT
On September 05, 2022, Unit 1 was operating at approximately 100% power. At 2345, a failure occurred of the cabling for
the Unit 1 Main Turbine shaft displacement probe channel 1 coupled with a previous failure of the channel 2 shaft
displacement probe, resulted in a shaft displacement signal that satisfied the trip logic for the shaft displacement
automatic trip of the Unit 1 Main Turbine and Reactor. The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically started as
expected.
A REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION
The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic
actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section." The Reactor Protection System (RPS)
automatically actuated and the AFW started as designed due to low-low steam generator water level following trip.
B. PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENT
On September 05, 2022 Unit 1 was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100% power.
C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE
EVENT AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT
There were no structures, systems, or components which were inoperable prior to the event which contributed to the
event. Prior to the main turbine trip, the main turbine and generator were performing their design functions.
D. NARATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES
On September 05, 2022, Unit 1 was operating at approximately 100% power. At 2345 a failure occurred on the Unit 1
Main Turbine shaft displacement probe channel 1 [EIIS:(TA)(DET)(CHA)(CBL)] coupled with a previous failure of the
channel 2 shaft displacement probe, resulted in a shaft displacement automatic trip of the Unit 1 Main Turbine. Because
reactor power at the time of the turbine trip was approximately 100% power, the Westinghouse permissive P-9 signal
was unblocked (power> 50%) as designed and when the turbine tripped an automatic reactor trip was actuated.
Reactor operators in the control room responded to the trip in accordance with Emergency Operating procedures. Entry
into the Emergency Plan was not required. Operators responded to the event and safely placed Unit 1 in Mode 3 .
E.THE METHOD OF DISCOVERY OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR PROCEDURAL PERSONNEL
ERROR
Operators (Utility, Licensed) in the Unit 1 Control Room received a "RX> 50% PWR TURB TRIP" alarm and confirmed
automatic Unit 1 reactor and turbine trips.
II. COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURES
A. CAUSE OF EACH COMPONENT OR SYSTEM FAILURE
The cause of this event was failure of the channel 1 Main Turbine shaft displacement probe coupled with a previous
failure of the channel 2 shaft displacement probe, satisfied the shaft displacement trip logic for the Turbine. The cause of
this failure was unwanted chafing of the shaft displacement probe cabling against the turbine pedestal, which led to the
failure of the shaft displacement probe.

NARRATIVE
B. FAILURE MODE, MECHANISM, AND EFFECTS OF EACH FAILED COMPONENT
The event was first noticed by the control room operators as both the unit 1 reactor and turbine automatically tripped. The
turbine trip was initiated by satisfying the trip logic for indications of excessive shaft displacement. The cabling for the shaft
displacement probe channels, in the Unit 1 Main Turbine, were chafing against the turbine pedestal, which ultimately led to
the failure of the channel 1 turbine shaft displacement probe and the previous failure of the channel 2 shaft displacement
probe, which satisfied the excessive shaft displacement trip logic to initiate an automatic trip of the Unit 1 Turbine.
C. SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY FAILURE OF COMPONENTS WITH
MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS
This event did not involve systems or secondary functions which were affected by the main turbine shaft displacement
probe failure.
D. FAILED COMPONENT INFORMATION
The Unit 1 Main Turbine shaft displacement probe is a Connection Technology Center model PRO part number
DP100103-00-06-10-01. As the probe is a non-critical system, CPNPP performed a PM at a frequency of 550 days
+/-25%, to look for degradation in the probe or any of its associated components, which will lead to a replacement. At the
time of the failure, the probe had been in service approximately 4 months.
III. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT
A. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES THAT OCCURRED
The Reactor Protection System responded as designed to the automatic turbine trip by initiating an automatic reactor trip.
The Auxiliary Feedwater System started as designed due to low-low steam generator water level following the trip.
B. DURATION OF SAFETY SYSTEM TRAIN INOPERABILITY
This event did not involve the inoperability of any safety component or system.
C. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT
A turbine trip is an American Nuclear Society Condition II event (Faults of Moderate Frequency). When the main turbine
tripped the reactor was automatically tripped and the Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically started to provide
feedwater to the steam generators.
Automatic turbine trip and automatic reactor trip were exercised and the Auxiliary Feedwater System started automatically
as expected and all plant safety systems responded as designed during the resultant transient. This event had no impact
on nuclear safety, reactor safety, radiological safety, environmental safety or the safety of the public. This event has been
evaluated as not meeting the definition of a safety system functional failure per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v).
IV. CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The cause of this event was the failure of the channel 1 Main Turbine shaft displacement probe, which satisfied the shaft
displacement trip logic for the Turbine. The cause of this failure was inadequate protection of the shaft displacement probe
cabling.

V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
All three of the Unit 1 Main Turbine shaft displacement probes installed during the trip went through troubleshooting to find
specific failures, and ultimately all three were replaced to facilitate startup. Subsequently, after startup, CPNPP operators
noticed that they were receiving spikes from multiple shaft displacement probe channels that were not indicative of actual
performance Therefore, CPNPP has defeated the shaft displacement automatic trip for the Unit 1 Main Turbine through
the next refueling outage, to avoid a similar trip. All other turbine protection features remain functional, and CPNPP has
established alternative monitoring methods for shaft displacement.
Future corrective actions include, developing and scheduling the implementation of a modification to the routing and
installation of the Main Turbine shaft displacement probe cabling to preclude the possibility of cable chafing, as well as
revising the operations procedure to provide added instructions for resolving Main Turbine digital alarms.
VI. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
There have been no previous similar reportable events at CPNPP in the past three years.
