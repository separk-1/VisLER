On July 20, 2021 at 1707 hours, an apparent non-compliance with 10CFR50, Appendix R, Section III.G.2 (separation of
redundant fire safe shutdown equipment) was identified during the development of the North Anna Fire Probabilistic Risk
Assessment. On July 22, 2021 at 1751 hours, a further review of the affected control circuits for the Unit 1 and Unit 2
Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) output breakers (EIIS Component BKR, System EK) and Emergency Bus feeder
breakers (HIS Component BKR, System EK) identified a concern that breaker position interlocks routed to or through
non-safety related components or spaces may affect the ability to provide emergency power on the affected unit due to
impacts on the control power circuits during an Appendix R fire associated with a loss of offsite power. An 8-hour non-
emergency report was made per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) for an unanalyzed condition. This event is reportable in
accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) for "Any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an
unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety."
Several control cables were identified within common fire areas that, if fire damaged, could prevent the availability of both
trains of Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) (EIIS Component DG, System EK) to start and power their respective
emergency buses (EIIS Component BU, System EB) required by the station's current Appendix R analysis. The following
issues were found:
1. Fire damage to control power cables for EDG output breakers may result in loss of control power and inability
to power the emergency bus without manual operator actions outside of the main control room.
2. Hot shorts on the normal/alternate supply breakers (EIIS Component BKR, System EK) could result in spurious
breaker operations that may prevent EDGs and/or emergency buses from performing its Appendix R function.
2.0 Significant Safety Consequences and Implications
No significant safety consequences resulted from this event. During this timeframe, North Anna Units 1 and 2 operated at
100% power. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.
3.0 Cause of the Event
The cause of this condition is the station's original post-fire safe shutdown analysis did not accurately assess the impact
on the equipment from associated cable damage due to fire for the select cables. In addition, the Multiple Spurious
Operations review effort failed to recognize applicability of EDG/Emergency Power scenarios for some areas for the plant.
4.0 Immediate Corrective Action
Hourly fire watches were established in the Unit 1 and Unit 2 Turbine Buildings, Unit 1 and Unit 2 Cable Spreading
Rooms, and Unit 1 and Unit 2 Normal Switchgear Rooms to mitigate the risk of fire and aid in early detection of fire. Risk
mitigating actions have been developed, implemented, and will continue to be performed until appropriate permanent
corrective actions are in place to mitigate this condition.

NARRATIVE
5.0 Additional Corrective Actions
A Reasonable Assurance of Safety (RAS) was developed with risk mitigating actions implemented until final resolution is
completed. Procedures ECA-0.0 (Loss of All AC Power) and Flex Support Guidelines (FSGs) were reviewed to mitigate
the results of a loss of all AC power conditions. Periodic reviews of applicable procedures and Fire Fighting Strategies for
fires in areas of concern have been established. Prior to any unavailability of the 'Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater
(TDAFW) pump (EIIS Component P, System BA), guidance has been provided to pre-stage the Beyond Design Basis
(BDB) Auxiliary Feedwater Pump.
The station is currently developing design changes to redesign the circuits to eliminate the vulnerability.
6.0 Actions to Prevent Recurrence
The applicable control cables associated with the EDG output breakers, and Emergency Bus normal and alternate feeder
breakers will be modified to regain compliance as required by Appendix R Safe Shutdown Analysis.
7.0 Similar Events
A review of internal operating experience was performed, and no similar events were identified that were previously
reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
8.0 Additional Information
Units 1 and 2 continued to operate at 100% power, Mode 1 during this discovery.
