On May 6, 2023, at 15:52 with Seabrook Unit 1 in Mode 3 at 0 percent power at normal operating temperature and pressure,
while performing Digital Rod Position Indication (DRPI) system surveillance testing, Shutdown Bank E stopped withdrawing. In
response, the Reactor Trip Breakers were manually opened, initiating a valid actuation of the Reactor Protection System.
Subsequently, at 22:53 of the same day, while performing DRPI system surveillance testing, Shutdown Bank C stopped
inserting. In response, the Reactor Trip Breakers were manually opened, initiating another valid actuation. The cause was found
to be failed Silicon Controlled Rectifiers associated with coil lifts. Action has been taken to send these cards to Corporate
Procurement Engineering and Dedication (CPED) for a root cause determination. Both events were reported pursuant to 10
CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) as events that resulted in valid actuation of the RPS. The RPS responded as designed during both
events and both events are being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as events that resulted in manual actuation of
the RPS. No other Structure, Systems, or Components (SSCs) contributed to these events. Neither event adversely impacted
the health and safety of the public.

Description
On May 6, 2023, at 15:52 with Seabrook Unit 1 in Mode 3 at 0 percent power at normal operating temperature and
pressure, while performing DRPI operability testing, Shutdown Bank E stopped withdrawing at 114 steps. A Rod Control
Urgent Failure Alarm was activated because rods could not step manually or automatically resulting in the inability to
incrementally control rod insertion. In response, operators responded as expected and the Reactor Trip Breakers (RTB)
[E1IS: BKR] were manually opened, initiating a valid actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS)[EIIS: JD]. At 22:53
on May 6, 2023, while performing DRPI system surveillance testing, Shutdown Bank C stopped inserting at 143 steps and
another Rod Control Urgent Failure Alarm was activated. In response, the RTBs were manually opened, initiating a second
valid RPS actuation that day. There were no SSCs that were inoperable at the beginning of this event that contributed to the
event. For both DPRI system test failures, immediate troubleshooting involved systematic testing of various circuit cards in
the shutdown bank C, D, E (SCDE)[EIIS:AA] cabinet and monitoring the rod lift signals.
Cause of the Event
The cause of the Rod Control Urgent Alarm preventing manual and automatic rod motion was identified through
troubleshooting as failed Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCR)[EI1S: 5CR] associated with lift coils. The SCRs were
manufactured by Westinghouse and actions are in place to determine the root cause of the failure (see corrective actions).
Analysis of the Event
This licensee event report is being provided pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as events that resulted in manual
actuation of a system listed 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). The RPS, including a reactor scram or reactor trip, is listed in 10
CFR 50.73(a) (2)(iv)(B)(1) as an event subject to the reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). The events did
not result in a Safety System Functional Failure.
Safety Significance
There were no safety consequences resulting from these events. During each event, the affected Shutdown Bank was
capable of being tripped to the fully inserted position. Thereby, the events had no impact on the health and safety of the
public. In addition, there were no other Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that contributed to the events.
Corrective Actions
1. Complete circuit card forensics at CPED.
2. Review preventative maintenance strategy to ensure periodic checks/replacements are aligned with original equipment
manufacturer. Implement any deficient preventative maintenance found. Determine if SCR and capacitor periodic
replacements are required.
3. Revise maintenance rule functional failure (MRFF) if necessary to evaluate performance failures based on
troubleshooting results.
