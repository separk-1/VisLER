On August 20, 2021, at 0905 eastern daylight time main control room operators were notified that auxiliary building
secondary containment enclosure (ABSCE) boundary Door A118 was open.(cid:9) This was discovered by Fix-it-now
personnel that were in the process of establishing compensatory measures associated with an active breach permit
for Door A118.(cid:9) A past operability evaluation determined that ABSCE Door A118 had been left open without
compensatory measures in place on four occasions between August 18 and August 20, 2021.(cid:9) The open door
created a breach of the ABSCE boundary that exceeded the allowed breach margin and rendered both trains of the
Auxiliary Building Gas Treatment System (ABGTS) inoperable.(cid:9) Additionally, the POE determined that due to the
unknown inoperability of the ABGTS, the requirements of Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.12 Condition E were
not met.
The cause of the event was miscommunication between the Work Control Center Senior Reactor Operator and
Maintenance Services personnel on the requirements of the ABSCE breaching procedure, related to the work being
performed, resulting in a breach permit not being issued when required. Corrective actions included revising the
ABSCE breaching procedure to clarify exception requirements and require a breach permit if an ABSCE door will
be left open greater than the allowable time and briefings with Operations personnel concerning the requirements of
the ABSCE breaching procedure.

NARRATIVE
I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event
At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 at 100 percent
rated thermal power.
II. Description of Event
A.(cid:9) Event Summary:
On August 20, 2021, at 0905 eastern daylight time (EDT), main control room (MCR) operators
were notified that auxiliary building [EIIS: NF] secondary containment enclosure (ABSCE)
boundary Door [EIIS: DR] A118 was open. This was discovered by Fix-it-now (FIN) personnel
that were in the process of establishing compensatory measures associated with an active
breach permit for Door A118. The arrival of FIN personnel, with a breach permit and
appropriate compensatory actions to close the door as required, allowed operators to
determine the ABSCE was operable at the time of discovery.
Investigation revealed Maintenance Services personnel had been taking equipment through
the door as part of ongoing work associated with a glycol chiller replacement project. The work
order had instructions to obtain an ABSCE breach permit; however, when Maintenance
Services personnel reported to the Work Control Center (WCC) to obtain the permit, the WCC
senior reactor operator (SRO) incorrectly determined an ABSCE breach permit was not
required. As a result, ABSCE Door A118 was left open without a breach permit and required
compensatory measures until FIN personnel discovered the issue at 0905.
A past operability evaluation (POE) determined that ABSCE Door A118 had been left open
without compensatory measures in place on four occasions between August 18 and
August 20, 2021 (the longest period the door was open without compensatory measures in
place was approximately 21 minutes). The open door created a breach of the ABSCE
boundary that exceeded the allowed breach margin. The four occasions should have caused
entry into Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.12,
Condition B for two trains of the Auxiliary Building Gas Treatment System (ABGTS) [EIIS: VF]
inoperable due to an inoperable ABSCE boundary in Mode 1, 2, 3, or 4 and Condition E for a
required train of ABGTS inoperable with fuel stored in the spent fuel pool. The inoperability of
two trains of the ABGTS during the required mode of applicability constitutes an event or
condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function of structures or systems that
are needed to: (C) control the release of radioactive material and (D) mitigate the
consequences of an accident. This LER documents the reportable event under 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).
Additionally, the POE determined that due to the unknown inoperability of the ABGTS, the
requirements of LCO 3.7.12 Condition E were not met. Condition E requires immediately
suspending all crane operations with loads over the spent fuel pool. Contrary to this

requirement, on three occasions loads were taken over the spent fuel pool as SQN was in the
process of receiving new fuel. Failure to immediately suspend crane operations constitutes an
operation or condition prohibited by TSs and is therefore being reported in accordance with
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).
B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event
and contributed to the event:
No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event.

G. Failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component:
There was no component that failed during the event.
H. Operator actions:
Operators instructed FIN personnel to close Door A118.
I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses:
None.
III. Cause of the Event
A.(cid:9) Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error:
The human performance factors related to this event were procedures, communications, and
work practices. The ABSCE breaching procedure requirements were not understood by
Maintenance Services personnel and not properly communicated by the WCC SRO. There was
a miscommunication concerning the scope of the work being performed and the need for a
breach permit. The work briefing with the WCC SRO resulted in a change to the work plan that
was not re-evaluated by stakeholders to identify its impact to the job plan.
B.(cid:9) Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause:
The cause of the event was miscommunication between the WCC SRO and Maintenance
Services personnel on the requirements of the ABSCE breaching procedure, related to the work
being performed, resulting in a breach permit not being issued when required.
Personnel involved were from the Operations and Maintenance Services groups. The Operations
personnel were NRC licensed, TVA employees. The Maintenance Services personnel were non-
licensed, supplemental workers. There were no schedule or situational pressures present.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the Event:
The ABGTS filters airborne radioactive particulates from the area of the fuel pool following a fuel
handling accident or loss of coolant accident (LOCA). In Mode 1, 2, 3, or 4, the ABGTS is required
to be operable to provide fission product removal associated with Emergency Core Cooling System
leaks due to a LOCA and leakage from containment and annulus. The analysis of the fuel handling
accident assumes that the ABSCE boundary is capable of being established to ensure the releases
from the auxiliary and containment buildings are consistent with the dose consequence analysis, no
credit is taken for filtration by the ABGTS.
ABGTS is a standby system that consists of two independent and redundant trains. Each train
consists of a heater, a prefilter, a high efficiency particulate air filter, an activated charcoal adsorber

section for removal of gaseous activity, and a fan. The system initiates filtered ventilation of the
auxiliary building following receipt of a high radiation signal from the fuel handling area radiation
monitors, a high radiation signal from the train-specific Auxiliary Building exhaust vent monitor, a
Phase A containment isolation signal from either reactor, or a high temperature signal from the
Auxiliary Building air intakes.
The breached door exceeded the allowed ABSCE breach margin rendering the ABSCE inoperable.
This configuration could have prevented the ABGTS from maintaining a pressure less than or equal
to -0.25 inches water gauge with respect to atmospheric pressure during the post accident
mode of operation.
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event. Engineering evaluation
determined that a delay associated with closing Door A118 would not have resulted in exceeding
10 CFR 100 dose limits. A probabilistic risk assessment determined there would be no
measurable changes to Core Damage Frequency or Large Early Release Frequency for this
event.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the
components and systems that failed during the event:
None.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident:
The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down.
C.(cid:9) For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service:
The arrival of FIN personnel at 0905, with a breach permit and appropriate compensatory
actions to close the door as required, allowed operators to determine the ABSCE was
operable at the time of discovery.
VI. Corrective Actions
The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP)
under condition reports (CRs) 1715829 and 1716097.

A. Immediate Corrective Actions:
Door A118 was closed. Operations conducted a prompt investigation associated with human
performance to identify actions that led to the event.
B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring
in the future:
Corrective actions included revising the ABSCE breaching procedure to clarify exception
requirements and require a breach permit if an ABSCE door will be left open greater than the
allowable time and briefings with Operations personnel concerning the requirements of the
ABSCE breaching procedure.
VII. Previous Similar Events at the Same Site:
LER 327 and 328/2018-002 was submitted for an exceeded breach margin that rendered both
trains of the ABGTS inoperable. An evaluation determined that the event was related, in part, to
a failure to review the requirements of the ABSCE breach permit. Corrective actions included
revising the associated work order to add a hold point to ensure the ABSCE permit is reviewed,
understood, and adhered to prior to and during breach.
VIII. Additional Information
There is no additional information.
IX. Commitments:
There are no commitments.
