On February 26, 2023 at 23:42, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the 1B Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) circulating lube oil
pump outlet coupling connection developed an oil leak resulting in the inoperability of the 1B EDG.
The cause of the leak was inadequate restraints on the piping, which allowed movement of the piping and resulted in a failure of the lube oil
pressure boundary by the piping separating from the coupling. An additional cause was determined to be inadequate troubleshooting from a
similar issue which occurred on November 4, 2022.
To correct the issue, the existing lube oil pipe restraint for the 1B EDG was modified, and a new additional restraint was installed. The
condition was later eliminated with the implementation of rigid piping. The troubleshooting process deficiencies and implementation
weaknesses were corrected by revisions to the procedures that clearly define roles, responsibilities and required documentation for issue
response, troubleshooting and corrective actions addressing deficient conditions.
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) due to the 1B EDG being inoperable, which failed to meet the LCO in accordance with
TS 3.0.1 and 3.8.1 between December 7, 2022, and March 3, 2023.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On February 26, 2023 at 23:42, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the 1B Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG)
[EllS Code: DG] circulating lube oil pump outlet coupling connection [EIIS Code: LL, CPLG] developed an oil leak when
the 2 inch lube oil piping became separated at the Flexmaster coupling location resulting in the inoperability of the 1B
EDG. The cause of the leak was inadequate restraints on the piping, which allowed movement of the piping and
resulted in a failure of the lube oil pressure boundary by the piping separating from the coupling.
EVENT ANALYSIS
The root cause analysis determined that the 1B EDG lube oil leak was caused by inadequate restraints on piping
adjacent to the circulating lube oil pump outlet Flexmaster coupling connection. The lack of adequate restraints allowed
movement of the adjacent piping which resulted in a failure of the lube oil pressure boundary by the piping separating
from the coupling. The 1B EDG Circulating Lube Oil Pump Discharge piping moved because the designed piping
restraint was inadequate to prevent movement.
An additional cause was determined to be troubleshooting process deficiencies and implementation weaknesses that
led to not identifying and correcting the 1B EDG circulating lube oil system failure mode in November 2022. The
February event was the second failure involving the 1B EDG coupling connection. The original leak occurred on
November 4, 2022, following the replacement of a flexible coupling on the 1B EDG as part of a new preventive
maintenance (PM) activity during an equipment outage. During the return to service maintenance run, the circulating
lube oil pump discharge coupling separated from the oil piping causing in an oil leak. The station leaders' oversight of
the lube oil leak evaluation and resolution activities was less than adequate to identify and correct the coupling
assembly failure.
REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT
As a result of the inadequate trouble shooting of the November 4, 2022 1B EDG lube oil leak and coupling assembly
separation, the 1B EDG was vulnerable to initiating events which could adversely affect the ability to supply emergency
power. From December 7, 2022 to March 3, 2023 while the plant was in the modes of Applicability, the 1B EDG was
inoperable. Based on the availability of redundant onsite power, no loss of safety function occurred during the
inoperability of the 1B EDG.
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) due to the 1B EDG being inoperable, which failed to meet the
LCO in accordance with TS 3.0.1 and 3.8.1 between December 7, 2022, and March 3, 2023.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED
The following corrective actions were taken
1. In February 2023, the existing lube oil pipe restraint for the 1B EDG was modified, and a new additional restraint was
installed. The condition was eliminated in October 2023 with the implementation of rigid piping.
2. Troubleshooting process deficiencies and implementation weaknesses were corrected by revisions to the procedures
that clearly define roles, responsibilities and required documentation for issue response, troubleshooting and corrective
actions addressing deficient conditions.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
There were no events from the last three years with either the same or similar cause to this event.
