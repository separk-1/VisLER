At 0830 PDT on 10/23/2022, during routine outage inspections on Unit 2, it was determined that the reactor coolant pressure
boundary did not meet American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section XI
acceptance criteria due to finding a through-wall indication at a 2-inch stainless steel socket weld (Weld No. WIB-975D) on the
cold leg Loop 1 vacuum refill connecting piping (Line No. 1140), and was therefore reportable.
This event is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) as a degraded condition.
The presumed cause of the degradation was vibration-induced fatigue propagation of a flaw initiated at a weld defect. Corrective
actions to address the condition consisted of performing a weld repair in accordance with ASME BPVC Section XI Case N-666-1
during the refueling outage.
There was no impact to the health and safety of the public or plant personnel.

NARRATIVE
I. Reporting Requirements
This event is being reported for Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 2 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)
and the associated guidance of NUREG-1022, Revision 3, as a degraded condition due to the failure to meet American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section XI acceptance criteria for a 2-
inch stainless steel socket weld (Weld No. WIB-975D) on the cold leg Loop 1 vacuum refill connecting piping (Line No.
1140).
This event was initially reported in Event Notification 56176 in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)
(A) as a degraded condition.
II. Plant Conditions
At the time of the event, DCPP Unit 2 was in MODE 6, Refueling during the twenty-third refueling outage for that unit
(2R23).
III. Problem Description
A. Background
Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] Line 1140 serves as a normally closed vacuum refill connection point on the RCS
Loop 1 cold leg piping downstream of reactor coolant pump (RCP) 2-1.(cid:9) The subject piping’s function is to facilitate the
vacuum refill method of filling the RCS when preparing for plant operation at the conclusion of a refueling outage.
DCPP Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 5.2.2.1 states, in part, that the reactor coolant pressure
boundary (RCPB) is defined as those piping systems and components that contain reactor coolant at design pressure and
temperature. RCPB piping systems and components are defined as Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) Quality/
Code Class I, with the exception of those RCPB components excluded from PG&E Quality/Code Class I requirements by
10 CFR 50.55a, as described in UFSAR Section 3.2.2.3. With the exception of the reactor coolant sampling lines, the
entire RCPB, as defined above, is located entirely within the containment structure.
The RCS boundaries are designed to accommodate the system pressures and temperatures attained under all expected
modes of plant operation, including all anticipated transients, and to maintain the stresses within applicable limits.
B. Event Description
At 0830 PDT on 10/23/2022, during routine outage inspections on Unit 2, it was determined that the RCPB did not meet
ASME BPVC Section XI acceptance criteria due to identification (boric acid residue) of a through-wall indication at a 2-
inch stainless steel socket weld (Weld No. WIB-975D) on the cold leg Loop 1 vacuum refill connecting piping (Line No.
1140), and was therefore reportable.
The event was subsequently reported in Event Notification 56176 in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.72(b)
(3)(ii)(A) as a degraded condition.

NARRATIVE
C. Status of Inoperable Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that Contributed to the Event
There were no SSCs that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the Event.
D. Method of Discovery
This condition was discovered during a routine piping and valve walkdown as part of the station’s boric acid corrosion
control program.
E. Operator Actions
None were required. The condition was discovered during routine walkdowns during plant refueling. There was no active
leak from the weld observed at the time of discovery.
F. Safety System Responses
None required.
IV. Cause of the Problem
The direct cause of the indication was vibration-induced fatigue propagation initiated at a weld flaw.
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
The condition did not adversely affect the health and safety of the public or on-site personnel. The boric acid residue
found was indicative of a through-wall leak and active leakage was not observed at the time the condition was identified in
Mode 6. Calculated total RCS leakage rates for the previous Unit 2 operating cycle were negligible, indicating that any
through-wall leakage was minimal. Additionally, the weld indication was localized in nature with no other accompanying
indications.
VI. Corrective Actions
The weld was repaired in accordance with ASME BPVC Section XI Code Case N-666-1. The weld repair was completed
on 10/31/2022 and passed required inspections. This was the only connecting piping of this configuration on the
remaining RCS loops. Finalization of the cause evaluation and implementation of corrective actions will be managed in
accordance with the DCPP Corrective Action Program.
VII. Additional Information
There have been no similar events at DCPP in the previous three years.
