On October 17, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) 2RY Transformer was de-energized when
operations personnel opened the 2RSY Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch instead of closing the
2RSX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch during restoration of the 2RX Transformer in the
substation. The de-energization of 2RY caused a loss of power to the Unit 2 4.16 KV Bus 23. This led to an auto-start of
121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump on a sensed low header pressure.
This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation.
Outage Shutdown Safety Assessment and Probability Risk Assessment remained green during the event and recovery
actions.
The cause of the de-energization of 2RY was individual errors during hard match and concurrent verification.
The corrective action implemented required all substation switching to be identified as high risk with field supervisor
oversight required.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On October 17, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP), Unit 1 was in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at
100 percent power and Unit 2 was in Mode 6 (Refueling) at 0 percent power. The 2RY Reserve Auxiliary Transformer was
supplying Safety Related 4.16 KV Bus 25 and the Non-Safety Related 4.16 KV Buses 23 and 24. At 1601 CDT, the 2RY
Reserve Auxiliary Transformer was de-energized when operations personnel opened the 2RSY Reserve Auxiliary
Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch instead of closing the 2RSX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B
Disconnect Switch during restoration of the 2RX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer in the substation. The de-energization of
2RY caused a loss of power to the Unit 2 Buses 23, 24, and 25. Automatic reenergization of Bus 25 via CT12
Transformer, the other offsite power source, occurred.
Bus 23 supplies power to Non-Safety Related 21 Cooling Water (CL) pump, which was supporting all the CL system loads.
Following the trip of 21 CL Pump, 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) auto started on a sensed low header
pressure. The 121 MDCLP is designed to start automatically if CL header pressure drops to 80 pounds per square inch
gauge (psig).
EVENT ANALYSIS
121 MDCLP
The 121 MDCLP is a part of the PINGP CL System (EIIS CODE: BI). The CL system is a ring header which is shared by
Units 1 and 2 that provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operational heat from safety-related components
during a design basis accident or transient. During normal and shutdown operation, the CL system also provides this
function for various safety-related and non-safety related components. The CL system consists of a common CL pump
discharge header for five CL pumps: two non-safety related pumps, two safety related Diesel Driven Cooling Water Pumps
(DDCLP), and 121 MDCLP that can be aligned as replacement for either DDCLP by realigning its power supply and
administratively disabling the CL pump discharge header valves to direct flow to the appropriate train.
The total Cooling Water (CL) system operating flow rates were in the range that operation of only one CL pump for both
Units was desired. The ring header valves were open and 121 MDCLP was not aligned as a replacement for either
DDCLP. The trip of 21 CL Pump resulted in a reduction in header pressure to the 121 MDCLP auto start setpoint.
This event is reportable per 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation.
Human Performance
PINGP Non-Licensed Operators (NLOs) were performing their first-time evolution of the tasks of restoring the 2RX
Reserve Auxiliary Transformer in the switchyard during the Unit 2 Refueling Outage. After successful closure of the 2RSX
Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV A Disconnect Switch, the NLOs opened the 2RSY Reserve Auxiliary Transformer
34.5KV B Disconnect Switch instead of closing the 2RSX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
Outage Shutdown Safety Assessment (SSA) and Probability Risk Assessment (PRA) remained green during the event and
subsequent recovery actions.
The auto start of 121 MDCLP did not challenge nuclear safety as the Cooling Water system responded as designed. This
event does not represent a safety system functional failure for Unit 1 or Unit 2.
CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The cause of the de-energization of 2RY was individual errors during hard match and concurrent verification.
