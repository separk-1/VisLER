On December 10, 2023 with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 (MPS3) at 47% power, while performing routine monthly
surveillance SP 3670.4, Monthly PMs, it was observed that the motor upper bearing oil level for the Unit 3 “C” containment
recirculation spray system pump (3RSS*P1C) was found below the allowable acceptance criteria. Past operability was reviewed,
and it was concluded that with the reduced oil level and leak at the upper motor bearing, the “C” RSS pump may not have
been capable of performing its safety function to meet its mission time requirement. The direct cause was oil leakage past the
O-ring of the upper motor bearing sight glass. Oil additions were made and upper sight glass assembly with O-rings were
replaced. This condition is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition prohibited
by the plant's Technical Specifications.

NARRATIVE
On December 10, 2023 with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 (MPS3) at 47% power, while performing routine monthly
surveillance SP 3670.4, Monthly PMs, it was observed that motor upper bearing oil level for Unit 3 “C” containment
recirculation spray system pump (3RSS*P1C) was found below the allowable acceptance criteria. The motor upper bearing
oil level was approximately 0.5 inches below the standstill mark on the sight glass. The allowable acceptance criteria for
the Recirculation Spray System (RSS) pump motor oil levels are “at standstill mark on sight glass to 0.25 inch above the
standstill mark.” Oil was added to the upper motor bearing on the same day which returned level to its acceptance criteria.
On August 30, 2023, there was evidence of oil leakage from the upper and lower motor oil level sight glass for “C” RSS
pump. A small oil puddle was found on the ground under the pump and oil droplets were observed on nearby structural
supports but both sight glass oil levels (upper and lower) were found at their allowable acceptance criteria. On October 31,
2023, the “C” RSS pump motor upper sight glass was replaced, new O-rings were installed in the lower motor bearing sight
glass and all post maintenance testing were found satisfactory with no oil leakage observed after 3RSS*P1C was run.
SP 3670.4, Monthly PM, surveillance procedure was performed on November 19, 2023 and found that oil level in
the 3RSS*P1C upper motor bearing was within acceptance criteria. There were no reports of oil leakage documented in
the operator logs or the corrective action program since the performance of the surveillances on November 19,
2023 and December 10, 2023 when oil level was found low. Past operability was reviewed and it was concluded
that with the reduced oil level and leak to the upper motor bearing, the “C” RSS pump may not have been capable of
performing its safety function to meet its mission time requirements. It was also determined that this condition existed
for longer than allowed by plant's Technical Specifications.
On January 4, 2024, the motor upper bearing oil level was found approximately 0.25 inches below the standstill mark. Oil
was added to the upper motor bearing bringing the oil level to the standstill mark. On January 13, 2024, new upper sight
glass assembly and O-rings were installed, and all post maintenance testing was found satisfactory with no oil leakage
observed.
Technical Specifications 3.6.2.2 “Recirculation Spray System” requires two independent recirculation spray system to be
operable in Modes 1, 2, 3 and 4. With one Recirculation Spray System inoperable, the action is to restore the inoperable
system to OPERABLE status within 72 hours or be in at least HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours. The action also
requires restoring the inoperable Recirculation Spray System to OPERABLE status within the next 48 hours or be in COLD
SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. Since the “C” RSS pump is credited as one of the two required recirculation
spray system loops, its operability could not be assured.
This condition is being reported as an operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications in accordance with 10
CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(i)(B).
CAUSE
The direct cause of the event was oil leakage past the O-ring of the upper motor bearing sight glass.

NARRATIVE
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
The RSS pumps are not active in the initial injection stage of Safety Injection and/or containment spray when the flow is
coming from the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST). As the RWST approaches emptying, the water source transitions
from the RWST to the containment sump and the plant transitions to the long-term sump recirculation mode.
There are two trains of RSS pumps, each train containing two RSS pumps. In recirculation mode, the RSS pumps take
suction from the containment sump. One pump in each train provides flow to a common containment recirculation
spray header. The second pump in each train provides recirculation flow to the suction of the Emergency Core Cooling
System (ECCS) charging and safety injection pumps for Reactor Coolant System (RCS) recirculation as well as feeding a
second common containment recirculation spray header.
In the preferred recirculation alignment, 3RSS*P1C is the “A” train RSS pump aligned to provide recirculation flow only
to the containment recirculation spray header. The other “A” train pump (3RSS*P1A) provides both RCS sump
recirculation and additional containment spray sump recirculation.
“A” train sump recirculation to the RCS via 3RSS*P1A is unaffected and containment recirculation spray flow from the
“A” train continues with a portion of the flow from the unaffected 3RSS*P1A.
The oil leak found in 3RSS*P1C does not affect the other “A” train pump (3RSS*P1A) providing both RCS sump
recirculation and additional containment spray sump recirculation. Nor did the oil leak affect the two RSS pumps in the
separate BRAVO train which was available. Only one train of RSS is necessary to meet the design bases function.
For the large break Loss of Coolant Accidents (LOCAs) and the spectrum of small break LOCAs analyzed, the maximum
10 CFR 50.46 criterion of Peak Clad Temperature (PCT), Maximum Local Oxidation (MLO) and Core-Wide Oxidation
(CWO) occur in the RWST ECCS injection phase. The RSS pumps are not participating in the RWST ECCS injection phase
of the event. Therefore, the core response to the LOCA transients is not changed from the FSAR Chapter 15 results.
The Large Break LOCA events cause the greatest challenge to the peak containment pressure. The peak pressure occurs
around 20 seconds after the initiation of the break. This is early in the quench spray phase of the event when spray flow
is coming from the RWST. Therefore, the peak containment pressure occurring during the LOCA is unaffected.
