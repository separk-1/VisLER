On October 27, 2021, at approximately 1430, with Unit 1 in Mode 6 at 0% power, the 1B Emergency Diesel
Generator (EDG) Load Sequencer was actuated by a valid undervoltage condition on the 1B 4160v Essential
Bus that occurred during 1B sequencer timer calibration activities.(cid:9) Valid actuation signals were sent to both the
1B EDG and the Unit 1 Auxiliary Feedwater (CA) System.(cid:9) Neither system automatically started as they were
both removed from service for maintenance activities at the time. Decay heat removal was maintained via 1A
train systems.
During performance of the 1B EDG sequencer timer calibration, jumpers equipped with mini grabbers are used
to place the sequencer into a test configuration.(cid:9) The cause of the event is the mini grabber placed during the
testing activity lost adequate connection which allowed the load sequencer to realign from the test condition.
This event was reported to the NRC as an eight-hour, non-emergency Event Notification Number 55549 on
October 27, 2021, per 10CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), Specified safety system actuation.

NARRATIVE
BACKGROUND
The following systems and component information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event
described in this LER. Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are
enclosed with brackets. Catawba Nuclear Station unique system and component identifiers are contained within
parentheses.
This event is being reported under the following criterion:
10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), for any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of the PWR
auxiliary feedwater system and the emergency AC electrical power system.
Engineered Safety Features Actuation System [JE](ISE), Diesel Generator Load Sequencer [EK]
(EQB)(EQC)
The onsite standby power source for each 4160 volt Engineered Safety Features (ESF) bus at Catawba is a
dedicated Diesel Generator [DG] (DG). For each unit, DGs A and B are dedicated to ESF buses ETA and ETB,
respectively. Each DG starts automatically on a Safety Injection (SI) signal (i.e., low pressurizer pressure or
high containment pressure) or on an ESF bus degraded voltage or undervoltage signal. After the DG has
started, it will automatically tie to its respective bus after offsite power is tripped as a consequence of ESF bus
undervoltage or degraded voltage, independent of or coincident with an SI signal. With no SI signal, there is a
ten-minute delay between the degraded voltage signal and the DG start signal. The DGs will also start and
operate in the standby mode without tying to the ESF bus on an SI signal alone. Following the trip of offsite
power, a sequencer strips loads from the ESF bus. When the DG is tied to the ESF bus, loads are then
sequentially connected to its respective ESF bus by the automatic load sequencer. The sequencing logic
controls the permissive and starting signals to motor breakers to prevent overloading the DG by automatic load
application.
In the event of a loss of preferred power, the ESF electrical loads are automatically connected to the DGs in
sufficient time to provide for safe reactor shutdown and to mitigate the consequences of a Design Basis
Accident (DBA) such as a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA).
Certain required unit loads are returned to service in a predetermined sequence in order to prevent overloading
the DG in the process. Approximately one minute after the initiating signal is received, all loads needed to
recover the unit or to maintain it in a safe condition are returned to service.
Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA](CA)
The Auxiliary Feedwater System assures sufficient feedwater supply to the steam generators in the event of
loss the condensate/feedwater system, to remove energy stored in the core and primary coolant. The CA
system may also be required in some other circumstances such as evacuation of the main control room or

cooldown after a loss-of-coolant accident for a small break, including maintaining a water level in the steam
generators following such a break.
The CA system is designed to start automatically in the event of a loss of offsite electrical power, trip of both
main feedwater pumps, safety injection signal, or low-low steam generator water level: any of which may result
in, coincident with, or be caused by a reactor trip. The CA system will supply sufficient feedwater to maintain
the reactor at hot standby for two hours followed by cooldown of the reactor coolant system to the temperature
at which the residual heat removal system may be operated.
The motor driven auxiliary feedwater pumps will automatically start and provide the minimum required
feedwater flow within one minute following any of these conditions:
• Trip of both main feedwater pumps
• AMSAC Actuation (ATWS Mitigation System and Actuation Circuitry)
• Two out of four (2/4) low-low level alarms in any one SG
• Initiation of a Safety Injection signal
• Loss of power to the 4160V essential bus
EVENT DESCRIPTION
At the time of the event. Unit 1 was in mode 6, 0% power for a scheduled refueling outage and Unit 2 was
operating in mode 1 at 100% power.
On October 27, 2021 at approximately 1430. with Unit 1 in Mode 6 at 0% power, during planned 1B EDG
sequencer timer calibration, the 4160 Volt essential power bus 1ETB de-energized when the feeder breaker
from transformer SATB opened. This undervoltage condition on the essential power bus actuated the 1B EDG
load sequencer which sent valid start signals to the 1B EDG and the Unit 1 CA system. Neither system
automatically started as they were both removed from service for planned maintenance activities at the time.
CAUSAL FACTORS
A fault tree was performed to investigate all potential equipment failures that could have resulted in this event
and all were refuted. The investigation concluded that a jumper which was placed with a mini grabber lost
adequate connection resulting in test relays changing state and re-establishing the normal system
configuration. Additionally, the procedure directing the timer calibration evolution did not have proper
verification controls during performance to manage/eliminate risk to prevent the loss of the essential bus.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
1. Power was restored to 1 ETB (complete)
2. Revise all unit and train related procedures to ensure proper controls are in place for timer calibration to
detect if the sequencer is removed from test condition and prevent opening the incoming and alternate
breakers. (complete)
3. Issue standing order to restrict mini grabber jumper usage unless proper controls and oversight have
been implemented. (complete)
4. Revise administrative maintenance procedure to restrict use of mini grabber leads for output blocking.
(planned)
SAFETY ANALYSIS
At the time of the event, Unit 1 was in Mode 6 at 0% power. Both the 1B Emergency Diesel Generator and
Auxiliary Feedwater systems were previously removed from service for maintenance. Unit 1 core cooling and
spent fuel cooling remained in service via 1A train equipment upon the loss of power to the 1B train essential
4160 Volt bus.
This event is considered low safety significance as decay heat removal was not challenged and all equipment
operated as designed.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
There have been no previous Licensee Event Reports at Catawba Nuclear Station in the last 3 years with the
same causal factor as this issue.
