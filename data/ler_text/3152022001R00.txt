16. Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On May 24, 2022, at 0414 EDT, Donald C. Cook Unit 1 was operating at approximately 12 percent power, while emerging
from the Unit 1 Cycle 31 refueling outage (U1C31) which included significant maintenance on the Unit 1 High Pressure
Turbine. While rolling the Unit 1 Main Turbine, it experienced high vibrations due to an apparent rub, and was manually tripped.
Following the Main Turbine trip, the high vibrations persisted, and the Unit 1 Reactor was manually tripped, the Main Steam
Stop Valves were closed, and main condenser vacuum was broken.
Following the reactor trip, Unit 1 continued to be supplied by offsite power. All control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary
Feedwater Pumps started as required and operated properly, no Safety Injection actuation was initiated or required, and
Decay Heat Removal was through the Unit 1 Steam Generator Power-Operated Relief Valves (SG PORVs). All required
equipment operated as expected, and the trip was not complicated.
The initiating event for the Unit 1 Manual Reactor Trip was to allow the control room operators to break Main Condenser
vacuum and prevent further potential damage to the Main Turbine due to the high vibrations.
The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid actuation of the
Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the manual reactor trip.

INTRODUCTION
On May 24, 2022, at 0414 EDT, Donald C. Cook Unit 1 was operating at approximately 12 percent power, while
emerging from the Unit 1 Cycle 31 refueling outage (U1C31) which included significant maintenance on the Unit 1
High Pressure Turbine [TA][TRB]. While rolling the Unit 1 Main Turbine, it experienced high vibrations due to an
apparent rub, and was manually tripped. Following the Main Turbine trip, the high vibrations persisted, and the
Unit 1 Reactor [RCT] was manually tripped, the Main Steam Stop Valves [SB][ISV] were closed, and main
condenser vacuum was broken. Due to the significant amount of maintenance done on the Main Turbine, the
potential for a turbine trip and/or a reactor trip was anticipated as part of the startup preparations.
All required equipment operated as expected, and the trip was not complicated. Following the reactor trip, Unit 1
continued to be supplied by offsite power. All control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps [BA][P]
started as required and operated properly, and no Safety Injection actuation was initiated or required. During the
event, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature initially lowered, as expected and was stabilized at
approximately 550 degrees F by the Steam Generator Power-Operated Relief Valves (SG PORVs) [SB][RV], after
the Main Steam Stop Valves were closed.
EVENT DESCRIPTION
The Main Turbine had been tripped twice the previous day. The first trip occurred on May 23, 2022 at 0620, with
the turbine at 500 rpm, due to excessive eccentricity and rising vibration, and the second trip occurred on May 23.
2022 at 1420, with the turbine at 1800 rpm, due to elevated thrust bearing temperature. The generator was not
connected to the grid prior to these turbine trips, and in both cases, the reactor remained critical since the turbine
trip occurred below P-8. The Power Range Neutron Flux (P-8) interlock is actuated at approximately 29% power
as determined by two-out-of-four Nuclear Instrumentation System (NIS) Power Range Detectors. The P-8
interlock automatically enables the reactor trip on Turbine Trip (Low Fluid Oil Pressure and Turbine Stop Valve
Closure) on increasing power.
At 0332 on May 24, 2022, control room operators rolled the Main Turbine a third time. At 0403, the turbine was
tripped at 1221 rpm due to high vibration on the #1 and #2 bearings. Vibrations continued to rise, following the
turbine trip, and at 0414, the reactor was manually tripped from approximately 12% power to permit breaking
vacuum in the Main Condenser[COND] and prevent further potential damage to the Main Turbine due to the high
vibrations.
Event Notification 55910 was submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), Reactor Protection System
(RPS) [JG] actuation as a four (4) hour non-emergency report, and under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), specified
system actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA], as an eight (8) hour non-emergency report.
The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid actuation
of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the manual reactor
trip.

COMPONENT
1-OME-76, Unit 1 High Pressure Turbine
CAUSE OF THE EVENT
A preliminary analysis has determined the cause of the turbine vibrations to be a rub on the high pressure turbine
shaft seals. An Apparent Cause Evaluation (ACE) is in progress at the time of the writing of this Licensee Event
Report (LER). If any information regarding the cause or corrective actions differs significantly from what is
documented in this LER, a supplement will be submitted after the conclusion of the ACE.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The #1 and #2 Main Turbine bearings were inspected for damage. Inspections on the #1 bearing revealed normal
wear marks and some additional areas that needed to be cleaned up. Inspections on the #2 bearing revealed
damage to the oil seal ring. The damage was repaired, and the final, as-left, bearing inspections and
measurements were found to be satisfactory. The Main Turbine and Main Generator were restored to operation
on May 30, 2022 at 0539.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
NUCLEAR SAFETY
All equipment operated as designed, and there was no actual or potential nuclear safety hazard resulting from the
Main Turbine high vibrations and subsequent turbine and reactor trips.
INDUSTRIAL SAFETY
There was no actual personnel safety hazard resulting from the Main Turbine high vibrations and subsequent
turbine and reactor trips.
RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY
There was no actual or potential radiological safety hazard, or radiological release, resulting from the Main Turbine
high vibrations and subsequent turbine and reactor trips.
PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT (PRA)
A PRA risk assessment was performed by calculating the Conditional Core Damage Probability (CCDP) and the
Conditional Large Early Release Probability (CLERP) of the transient initiating event. A comparison of the results
of these calculations, to the thresholds provided in NRC Inspection Manual Chapter (IMC) 0609, determined this
event to be of "very low" safety significance.
