On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the reactor
protection system was automatically actuated due to low reactor coolant flow while conducting main generator testing activities.
The operators responded timely by stabilizing the plant and removing decay heat by the steam generator power operated relief
valves. The cause of the event was incorrect turbine control valve logic setting which resulted in inadequate turbine speed and
generator voltage. The corrective action for this event adjusted the turbine control valve logic setting to open the valves
sufficiently to maintain turbine speed and generator output voltage to support house loads during operation in island mode (with
the generator disconnected from the grid and supplying unit auxiliary loads).
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor
protection system, which tripped the reactor. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the
Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EllS: JC] was automatically actuated during main generator system [EIIS: EL] startup
testing. While performing procedure 3-ZAS-MEM-002, "Main Generator Initial Synchronization Testing," with the main
generator connected to the offsite power grid and supplying approximately 65 Megawatts (MW), the switchyard breakers
[EIIS: FK / BKR] ZBS-161750 and ZBS-161850 were opened to disconnect the main generator from the offsite power grid
and place the generator into island mode (supplying unit auxiliary loads). Shortly after placing the main generator in island
mode, the turbine control system [EIIS: JJ] was not able to automatically maintain speed at the required 1800 rpm. This
caused a reduction of speed and output voltage from the main generator, which resulted in a reduction in the speed of the
Reactor Coolant Pumps [EIIS: AB / P]. This caused reduction in the reactor coolant flowrate, which resulted in the
automatic RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the
event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in
automatic actuation of the RPS.
EVENT ANALYSIS
The cause of this event was an incorrect turbine control valve setting, which was not identified through oversight of legacy
design. The turbine control valve high limit setting was not set to maintain house loads during island mode operation. The
turbine control valve high limit setting was set at 7 percent, which was a default value for turbine speed control and was not
sufficient to support island mode operation. The software was changed to increase the high limit setting from 7 to 25
percent to support island mode operation.
SAFETY ASSESSMENT
There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the
plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely following the reactor trip by ensuring plant stability and decay
heat was removed by steam generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as
expected as a result of the event. There were no equipment failures that contributed to the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4
were unaffected by this event.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The turbine control valve setting was corrected by a software design change to increase the setting from 7 to 25 percent.
