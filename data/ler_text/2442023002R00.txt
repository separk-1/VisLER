On 9/9/2023 at 1143, Ginna Unit 1 tripped from a 100% power steadyrstate condition. No plant evolutions were in progress at
the time. Operators initially noticed vibration coming from the turbine building, indication of open steam dump valves, and
control rods inserting. All turbine control and intercept valves had closed causing a 100% load rejection transient. The reactor
tripped approximately 7 seconds into the transient on Overtemperature Delta Temperature (protection from departure from
nucleate boiling). Closure of both the control and intercept valves indicates that the auxiliary governor solenoids on the
governor pedestal actuated upon a signal from the Overspeed Protection Circuit (OPC). Troubleshooting revealed that OPC
circuitry was actuating while at / below rated input speed (1,800 RPM). Two Root Causes were identified: RC1: failure of
Analog Comparator 8, EHCC1/1A08R, and subcomponent R2C (Resistor), and RC2: failure by personnel to implement the Parts
Quality Initiative process which allowed material not from inventory to be installed in the plant. The failed card was replaced
with a stock spare, and system tests were then satisfactory. Corrective actions for RC2 have been identified and are ongoing.

NARRATIVE
I.P RE-EVENT PLANT CONDITIONS
At the time of the component failure, the plant was in MODE 1 at 100% rated thermal power.
II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
A. EVENT
On 9/9/2023 at 1143, Ginna Unit 1 tripped from a 100% power steady-state condition. No plant evolutions were in
progress at the time. Operators initially noticed vibration / noise coming from the turbine building, indication of steam
dump valves being open, and control rods inserting. All the turbine control and intercept valves had closed resulting in a
100% load rejection transient. The reactor tripped approximately 7 seconds into the transient. The “first out” annunciator
was for an Overtemperature Delta Temperature (OTDT) Trip (protection from departure from nucleate boiling).
As expected for a complete load rejection, the Power Operated Relief Valves (PORVs) opened to mitigate the pressure
transient prior to the setpoint for reactor trip being reached. The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) pumps started on an
Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) Mitigation System Actuation Circuitry (AMSAC) signal. Following the trip
and entry into MODE 3, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature lowered (later identified to be due to seat leakage on
some of the steam dump valves). The Operators stabilized the plant in by closing the Main Steam Isolation Valves and
then controlled Tavg using Atmospheric Relief Valves (ARVs).
Closure of both the control and intercept valves indicates that the auxiliary governor solenoids (20-1AG and 20-2AG) on
the governor pedestal actuated upon a signal from the Overspeed Protection Circuit (OPC). Troubleshooting revealed
that OPC circuitry was actuating while at / below rated input speed (1,800 RPM). Two Root Causes (RC) were identified:
RC1 – an operational equipment failure of component Analog Comparator 8, EHCC1/1A08R, and subcomponent R2C
(Resistor), and RC2 – failure by personnel to implement the Parts Quality Initiative (PQI) process which allowed material
not from inventory to be installed in the plant. The failed card was replaced with a stock spare, and system tests were
then satisfactory. Corrective actions for RC2 have been identified and are ongoing.
B. INOPERABLE STRUCTURES, COMPONENTS, OR SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT:
No other Systems, Structures, or Components (SSCs) were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the
event.

D. OTHER SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS AFFECTED:
None
E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY:
Self-revealing: while at a 100% power steadyHstate condition with no plant evolutions in progress, Operators initially
noticed vibration / noise coming from the turbine building, indication of steam dump valves being open, and control rods
inserting. Within approximately 7 seconds, the reactor tripped on OTDT.
F. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES:
During the transient, prior to the reactor trip, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached the Power Operated Relief
Valve (PORV) actuation setpoint. The PORVs opened to mitigate the pressure increase. The reactor trip on OTDT was
not complex, and all systems responded normally post-trip. The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System actuated as expected
based on a signal from the Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) Mitigation System Actuation Circuitry (AMSAC)).
III. CAUSE OF EVENT:
Root Cause 1 is the operational equipment failure of the Analog Comparator 8 card in the 1A08R location
(EHCC1/1A08R) due to failure of a subcomponent, resistor R2C.
Root Cause 2 is the failure by personnel to implement the Parts Quality Initiative (PQI) process which allowed material not
from inventory to be installed in the plant.
IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE SAFETY CONSEQUENCES OF THE EVENT:
Per UFSAR 15.0.8.2, this reactor trip falls under Condition II - Faults of Moderate Frequency. The plant was capable of
being returned to operation after corrective action. As there was no loss of any barrier to the escape of radioactive
products, there was no release of radioactive materials in effluents to unrestricted areas (in conformance with 10 CFR 20,
Standards for Protection Against Radiation). The event did not propagate to a more serious incident of the Condition III or
Condition IV type.

NARRATIVE
Due to the Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation while critical, this event was reportable as a four-hour, non-
emergency notification per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and an eight-hour non-emergency notification per 10 CFR 50.72(b)
(3)(iv)(A) for a valid specified system actuation (AFW). The event is 60-day reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for
actuation of both the RPS and the AFW system. There was no violation of Technical Specifications.
As such, this event is not considered to have had any significant effect on the health and safety of the public.
V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
For the equipment root cause, the Analog Comparator 8 card at 1A08R was replaced with a stock spare and the system
was tested satisfactory.
An extent of condition was performed, limited to the failed resistor (R2C 10kW) on the EHCC1/1A08R card. The resistor
that failed was a precision wire wound resistor (model SX158D manufactured by Precision Resistor Company (PRC)) and
is utilized on multiple SPV card locations within the EH control cabinet. These other card locations are susceptible to the
same condition and failure mode. Additionally, precision wire wound resistors may be utilized in other electronic systems
within the plant which contain SPV circuit cards. Actions were created to address locations within the EHC cabinet and
other systems which may be susceptible to the same condition.
For the human performance root cause, proper procedural guidance exists but was not implemented before this event.
Corrective actions focus on compliance / extent of condition and include:
• Completing PQI for all stock and uncontrolled (not from inventory) EH cards.
• In G1R45 (next RFO), performing PQI on all installed cards and replacing all degraded resistors.
• Adding PQI to all card refurbishment strategies, both site- and vendor-performed.
• Ensuring that per SM-AA-4003 critical spares are properly identified, as this identification drives inspections per the PQI.
VI. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
This failure was documented in Corrective Action Program Issue Report (IR) 04701420.
A. FAILED COMPONENTS:
Analog Comparator 8 card in the 1A08R location (EHCC1/1A08R) in the turbine Overspeed Protection Circuit.
B. PREVIOUS LERs ON SIMILAR EVENTS:
A search of all Ginna LERs submitted to the NRC determined that no similar event has occurred.
