On July 25, 2021, at 0544 eastern daylight time (EDT), the SQN Unit 2 ice bed temperature monitoring system
stopped providing accurate data for the ice bed. The data is used to complete a surveillance instruction (SI) to
verify the ice bed temperature does not exceed 27 degrees Fahrenheit (F) as required by Technical
Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.12.1 at a Frequency of every 12 hours. Due to the
failure, Main Control Room operators authorized performance of 2-SI-IXX-061-138.0, Backup Ice Condenser
Temperature Monitoring. At 1258, SR 3.6.12.1 was successfully performed; however, the completion time
exceeded the specified Frequency plus the 25 percent extension allowed by SR 3.0.2 by 20 minutes (SR
3.6.12.1 had last been completed at 2138 on July 24). Therefore, the Unit 2 ice bed was declared inoperable
for 20 minutes from 1238 until 1258.
The cause of the event was the failure of the ice bed temperature monitoring system remote scanner due to
an internal power supply failure. Corrective actions for this event include developing procedural guidance for
the response required for a nonfunctional ice bed temperature monitoring system and replacement of obsolete
instrumentation in the ice bed temperature monitoring system.

NARRATIVE
I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event
At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated
thermal power.
II. Description of Event
A.(cid:9) Event Summary:
On July 25, 2021, at 0544 eastern daylight time (EDT), the SQN Unit 2 ice bed [EIIS: BC]
temperature monitoring system stopped providing accurate data for the ice bed due to the
failure of a remote scanner [EIIS: MPX] in the system. The data is used to complete a
surveillance instruction (SI) to verify the ice bed temperature does not exceed 27 degrees
Fahrenheit (F) as required by Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement
(SR) 3.6.12.1 at a Frequency of every 12 hours. Due to the failure, Main Control Room (MCR)
operators authorized performance of 2-SI-IXX-061-138.0, Backup Ice Condenser Temperature
Monitoring, which requires calling in instrumentation and controls technicians to take resistance
temperature detector readings on individual temperature elements inside containment.
At 1258, SR 3.6.12.1 was successfully performed; however, the completion time exceeded the
specified Frequency plus the 25 percent extension allowed by SR 3.0.2 by 20 minutes
(SR 3.6.12.1 had last been completed at 2138 on July 24). SR 3.0.1 states, in part, “[f]ailure to
perform a Surveillance within the specified Frequency shall be failure to meet the LCO [limiting
condition for operation].” Therefore, the Unit 2 ice bed was declared inoperable for 20 minutes
from 1238 until 1258.
At 1600, an 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 55379) was made to the NRC in
accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v), as an event or condition that could have prevented the
fulfillment of a safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (C) control the
release of radioactive material and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident. This LER is
submitted based on NUREG-1022, Revision 3, Section 3.2.7 guidance that identifies that the
requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) apply when a system that is within the scope of the
criterion is declared inoperable and no redundant system or equipment could be declared
operable (the ice bed is a single train system).
Although the Frequency of SR 3.6.12.1 was exceeded and required the Unit 2 ice bed to be
declared inoperable, the Unit 2 ice bed remained below 27 degrees F and capable of
performing its required safety function to provide a heat sink during a Design Basis Accident
(DBA) in containment. Therefore, no loss of safety function occurred.

G. Failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component:
The failure mode and mechanism of the component are unknown. The failure of the component
caused the ice bed temperature monitoring system to become nonfunctional.
H. Operator actions:
Operations personnel authorized a conditional performance of 2-SI-IXX-061-138.0, Backup Ice
Condenser Temperature Monitoring.
I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses:
There were no automatic or manually initiated safety system responses associated with this
event.
III. Cause of the Event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error:
The cause of the event was the failure of the ice bed temperature monitoring system remote
scanner due to an internal power supply failure.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause:
There was no identified human performance related root cause.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the Event:
The ice bed consists of a minimum of 1,916,000 pounds of ice stored within the ice condenser. The
primary purpose of the ice bed is to provide a large heat sink in the event of a release of energy
from a DBA in containment. The ice would absorb energy and limit containment peak pressure and
temperature during the accident transient. Limiting the pressure and temperature reduces the
release of fission product radioactivity from containment to the environment in the event of a DBA.
The Unit 2 ice bed remained below 27 degrees F and remained capable of performing its required
safety function to provide a heat sink during a DBA in containment.
V.(cid:9) Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no actual safety consequences as a result of the ice bed inoperability. No actual loss
of safety function occurred. The ice mass required for a DBA in containment was available.

A.(cid:9) Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the
components and systems that failed during the event:
None.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident:
The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down.
C.(cid:9) For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service:
The ice bed is a single train safety system that was rendered inoperable for approximately
20 minutes.
VI. Corrective Actions
The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP)
under condition reports (CRs) 1709839 and 1709881.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions:
Operations personnel authorized the conditional performance 2-SI-IXX-061-138.0, Backup
Ice Condenser Temperature Monitoring, so the ice bed temperatures could be obtained.
B.(cid:9) Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring
in the future:
Corrective actions for this event include developing procedural guidance for the response
required for a nonfunctional ice bed temperature monitoring system and replacement of obsolete
instrumentation in the ice bed temperature monitoring system.
VII. Previous Similar Events at the Same Site:
LER 2-2020-001-00 was submitted for an inoperable Unit 2 ice bed. The cause of the event was
the failure of a gasket on vendor supplied equipment at the flanged connection of the Auxiliary
Glycol Cooling System skid. The corrective action was to repair the skid.
LER 1-2021-002-00 was submitted for an inoperable Unit 1 ice bed (although reported in 2021,
the event occurred in 2018). The cause of the event was the failure of the Unit 1 ice bed
temperature monitoring system temperature recorder. The corrective action was to replace the
ice bed temperature monitoring system temperature recorder.
