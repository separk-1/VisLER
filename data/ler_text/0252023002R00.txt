On March 15, 2023, at 2157 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, during
startup testing, the Reactor Protection System automatically actuated. The operators responded timely by ensuring plant
stability, with decay heat removal accomplished by steam generator power operated relief valves. The cause of the event was
incorrect protective relay settings on Medium Voltage Switchgear buses ES-4 and ES-6, due to less than adequate questioning
attitude, validation of assumptions, and interface/guidance. The corrective actions for this event include the proper setting of the
protective relays for buses ES-4 and ES-6 and the revision of guidance for issuing work instructions to include a statement to
ensure that the scope of work includes those items listed as additional equipment when multiple components are included in a
single work order. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection
System. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On March 15, 2023, at 2157 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power,
during startup testing, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EIIS: JC] automatically actuated. The initiating event was a
Unit 3 main turbine [EIIS: TA / TRB] trip due to a differential trip of the excitation transformer protective relays [EIIS: EL /
87]. After the turbine trip, the fast bus transfer function failed on non-safety related alternating current (AC) power buses
ES-4 and ES-6 [EIIS: EA / BU] due to incorrect protective relay settings [EIIS: EA / RLY]. The loss of voltage on the affected
AC power buses resulted in the loss of two (2) of the four (4) Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs) [EIIS: AB / P]. The loss of
these RCPs initiated the RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the
beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition
that resulted in automatic actuation of the RPS.
EVENT ANALYSIS
The cause of the RPS actuation was incorrect settings on Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories protective relays (SEL 451)
on Medium Voltage Switchgear buses ES-4 and ES-6, due to less than adequate questioning attitude, validation of
assumptions, and interface/guidance. Changes to the relay settings for buses ES-4 and ES-6 were being implemented by
Maintenance under one (1) work order. Work Management specifically identified bus ES-1 in the work order scope. The
relays for buses ES-4 and ES-6 were included as additional equipment in the work order, but they were not included in the
work scope. As a result, the implementation of the design change for the relay settings was only implemented on the relay
for bus ES-1. Consequently, settings for relays on buses ES-4 and ES-6 were not changed as intended by the work order.
This resulted in failure of the fast bus transfer function due to the relay settings, resulting in the loss of voltage to two (2)
RCPs.
SAFETY ASSESSMENT
There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the
plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by steam
generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event.
VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• The settings were corrected for protective relays for Medium Voltage Switchgear buses ES-4 and ES-6, which were not
included in the scope of work in the original work order. Prior to correction of the relay settings, Medium Voltage Switchgear
buses ES-4 and ES-6 were aligned to the Reserve Auxiliary Transformers during subsequent testing to place the main
generator on-line. This alignment avoids the need for the fast-bus transfer function, if a main generator lockout were to
occur.
• Guidance for issuing work instructions will be revised to include a statement that ensures that the scope of work includes
items listed as additional equipment, when multiple components are worked under a single work order. This is expected to
be completed by June 13, 2023.
