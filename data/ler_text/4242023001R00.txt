On January 03, 2023 at 2259 EST, with both Unit 1 and Unit 2 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, an automatic actuation of the
Unit 1 Bravo and the Unit 2 Alpha Emergency Diesel Generator Systems and associated Auxiliary Feedwater Systems occurred.
These systems actuated due to the failure of a lightning arrestor associated with the Unit 1 Bravo Reserve Auxiliary Transformer.
This resulted in the upstream breaker to the Unit 1 Bravo and Unit 2 Alpha Reserve Auxiliary Transformers opening, causing the
Unit 1 Bravo and Unit 2 Alpha emergency electrical buses to de-energize and the automatic start of the associated Emergency
Diesel Generator and Auxiliary Feedwater Systems. The units remained in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, and the operating
crew performed as expected. The lightning arrestor was replaced and the Reserve Auxiliary Transformers were returned to
service.
Due to the automatic actuation of the Emergency Diesel Generator and Auxiliary Feedwater Systems on each unit, this event is
being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).

NARRATIVE
NARRATIVE
A. Event Description
On January 3, 2023 at 2259 EST, with both Unit 1 and Unit 2 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, a partial loss of offsite
power occurred due to a failed Hubbell MVN lightning arrestor [LAR] on the Unit 1 Bravo Reserve Auxiliary Transformer
(RAT)[XFMR].
This resulted in the upstream breaker [BKR] to the Unit 1 Bravo and Unit 2 Alpha Reserve Auxiliary Transformers opening,
causing the Unit 1 Bravo and Unit 2 Alpha emergency electrical buses to de-energize and the automatic start of the
associated Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG)[EK] and Auxiliary Feedwater Systems (AFW)[BA].
There were no Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that were out of service at the beginning of the event that
contributed to the event.
Due to the actuation of the EDG and the AFW systems this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)
(iv)(A).
B. Cause of Event
The cause of the event was a failure of the lightning arrestor on the Unit 1 Bravo Reserve Auxiliary Transformer.
C. Safety Assessment
When the lightning arrestor failed, the upstream breaker for offsite power opened. This resulted in one safety-related
electrical bus on each unit becoming de-energized. The EDGs associated with the affected electrical buses started
automatically and re-energized the electrical buses. The AFW systems started as a result of the electrical bus being de-
energized. All the systems operated as designed. The operating crew responded as expected. The event was within the
analysis of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15. There were no safety consequences as a result of this
event.
D. Corrective Actions
The lightning arrestor for the affected transformer was replaced.
E. Previous Similar Events
None.
