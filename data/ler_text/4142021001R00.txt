On April 20, 2021, during the performance of the Catawba Nuclear Station Unit 2 reactor vessel closure head (RVCH)
examinations, it was determined the Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 did not meet the requirements of 10 CFR
50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D) and ASME code case N-729-6. A relevant ultrasonic testing (UT) leak path indication was identified on
Unit 2, nozzle penetration 74. The indication was confirmed in the J-groove weld with supplemental eddy current and
liquid penetrant surface examinations. A bare metal visual examination of the RVCH was performed with no visual
evidence of head penetration leakage detected.
The cause of the Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 relevant indication is due to Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking
(PWSCC) from the Alloy 82/182 weld application in the primary system. Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 was repaired
in accordance with the NRC approved Westinghouse embedded flaw repair method (WCAP-15987-P-A) and Duke Energy
relief request RA-21-0145.
This event was reported to the NRC as an eight-hour, non-emergency Event Notification Number 55201 on April 21, 2021,
per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A). This report is being submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A), "any event or
condition that results in the condition of the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously
degraded."

NARRATIVE
BACKGROUND
The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER. Applicable
Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets. Catawba Nuclear Station
unique system and component identifiers are contained within parentheses.
On April 20, 2021, Unit 2 of Catawba Nuclear Station (CNS) was in a scheduled refueling outage (Refueling, 0% power)
for cycle 24 (C2R24). During the outage, the inspection of the reactor vessel closure head (RVCH) [RPV] penetration
nozzles [NZL] occurred. The RVCH is a Westinghouse Design manufactured by Combustion Engineering.
No Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to the event.
No change in plant mode or in reactor power occurred as a result of this event.
EVENT DESCRIPTION
During the Catawba Spring 2021 outage, as a part of the ultrasonic examination (UT) for the in-service inspection at
Catawba Nuclear Station Unit 2, a leak path indication was found in the reactor vessel head nozzle penetration 74.
Subsequent, manual eddy current testing (ECT) examination revealed a single relevant circumferential linear indication on
the surface of the J-groove weld approximately 0.8" from the lowest point on the downhill side counter-clockwise looking
up, and 0.5" from the toe of the weld. Duke Energy performed a bare metal visual inspection in accordance with ASME
Code Case N-729-6, Table 1, with no relevant visual indications indicative of nozzle leakage detected. The indication was
identified on April 20, 2021, at 2230.
A liquid penetrant (PT) examination was performed on the J-groove weld and confirmed a relevant indication located 0.8"
from the lowest point on the downhill side counter-clockwise looking up, and 0.6" from the toe of the weld. The indication
was described to be a "rounded liquid penetrant indication 1/16 inch in diameter". The ECT and PT surface examinations
identified the relevant indication at the same position on the weld. As a result of the change in backwall reflectivity
observed during the ultrasonic leak path assessment and the relevant indication detected by both supplemental surface
examination methods (ECT and PT), repair of the J-groove weld was required during the refueling outage.
Due to the relevant indication described above, a repair of the nozzle penetration 74 J-groove weld was necessary. The
Westinghouse embedded flaw repair process was implemented for nozzle penetration 74. The embedded flaw repair
process involves depositing weld material, which is Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) resistant, over the
entire surface of the J-groove weld on the penetration nozzle of interest, as well as over the outside surface of the nozzle
tube. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55a(z)(1), Duke Energy submitted relief request RA-21-0145, which proposed the repair of
the J-groove weld of RVCH nozzle penetration 74 using an embedded flaw repair process as an alternative to the defect
removal and weld repair provisions of ASME Section XI, IWA-4000 and ASME Section III, NB-4450. The proposed
embedded flaw repair process is described in WCAP-15987-P-A. Duke Energy received NRC verbal authorization on April
24, 2021, for relief request RA-21-0145.
This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A), "Any event or condition that results in the condition
of the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously degraded" because the linear indication
did not meet the applicable acceptance criterion referenced in ASME Code Case N-729-6, as conditioned by 10 CFR
50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D).

CAUSAL FACTORS
The cause of the Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 relevant indication is due to Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking
from the Alloy 82/182 weld application in the primary system. Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 was repaired in
accordance with the NRC approved Westinghouse embedded flaw repair method (WCAP-15987-P-A) and Duke Energy
relief request RA-21-0145.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 relevant indication was repaired in accordance with the NRC approved
Westinghouse embedded flaw weld repair method (WCAP-15987-P-A) and Duke Energy relief request RA-21-0145.
SAFETY ANALYSIS
This event had no effect on the health and safety of the public. A relevant UT leak path indication was identified on Unit 2,
nozzle penetration 74. A bare metal visual examination of the RVCH was performed with no visual evidence of head
penetration leakage detected. The timely RVCH inspection and repair of the identified indication prevented further
degradation from occurring. All of the RVCH head penetrations were inspected during the C2R24, and only nozzle
penetration 74 was found to have an indication requiring repair. There were no actual safety consequences for the event.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
There have been no previous Licensee Event Reports at Catawba Nuclear Station in the last 3 years with the same cause
on this issue. Catawba Unit 1 submitted an LER in May 2020 for RVCH nozzle penetration 18 for an indication that was
attributed to a localized weld fabrication anomaly (not PWSCC).
