On June 22, 2021, the Waste Processing Building (WPB) Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was found to
have incorrect database values used for flow rate measurement, which rendered this monitor inoperable. The database values
for this radiation monitor were immediately corrected upon discovery of this condition and operability was restored on June 22,
2021. Following investigation, it was determined that this radiation monitor was inoperable since October 6, 2020. During
completion of a surveillance test on this radiation monitor on October 6th, the database values were restored incorrectly.
Maintenance personnel did not recognize a note in the Radiation Monitor Data Sheet Library that requires substitute values to be
entered when the flow transmitter for this radiation monitor is inoperable. Since this radiation monitor was not known to be
inoperable from October 6, 2020, through June 22, 2021, no alternate method for monitoring was implemented and no special
report was completed as required by Technical Specifications (TS). The WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation
Monitor is credited as one of two WPB exhaust effluent monitors in TS Table 3.3-10, Accident Monitoring Instrumentation. This
event had no significance with respect to the health and safety of the public. Actions to ensure tracking of the flow rate monitor
status have been completed.

NARRATIVE
Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets [].
A. Background
Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was in Mode 1 at 100% reactor [RCT] power when the Waste
Processing Building (WPB) [NE] Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation [IL] Monitor [MON] was declared
inoperable. No other systems, structures or components were inoperable at the time that contributed to the event.
The WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor is credited as one of two WPB exhaust effluent
monitors in Technical Specification (TS) Table 3.3-10, Accident Monitoring Instrumentation, that are required to be
operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3, in accordance with TS 3.3.3.6. The WPB exhaust effluent monitors provide an indication to
operations personnel of the overall airborne activity in the WPB effluent at release points 5 and 5A. During the time period
that the WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was inoperable, either the WPB Vent Stack 5 High
Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was operable or its alternate preplanned monitoring method was implemented.
This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as “any operation or condition which was prohibited
the plant’s Technical Specifications,” because there is evidence the WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation
Monitor was inoperable for greater than the time allowed by HNP TS prior to discovery.
Additionally, TS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.0.4 requires all LCOs to be met for the plant condition to be
entered, prior to entry. There has been an unplanned forced outage, a planned refueling outage, and a planned forced
outage at HNP since October 6, 2020. On these occasions, HNP was returned to Mode 3 without personnel being aware
of this condition and the LCO for TS 3.3.3.6 was not met, which is prohibited by TS LCO 3.0.4.
B. Event Description
On June 22, 2021, the WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was found to have incorrect
database values used for flow rate measurement, which rendered this monitor inoperable. The flow transmitter [FT] used
for this radiation monitor has been inoperable since July 7, 2020, which requires use of pre-established substitute values
in the database to maintain operability of this radiation monitor. On June 22, 2021, a Radiation Protection (RP) technician
identified that the database values used for monitoring flow that supports this radiation monitor’s monitoring function were
not appropriate, as the values being used were for the flow transmitter being in an operable status. From investigation, the
incorrect database values were present since October 6, 2020, when personnel conducting a surveillance test activity on
this radiation monitor inadvertently entered incorrect database values. Maintenance personnel did not recognize a note in
the Radiation Monitor Data Sheet Library that requires substitute values to be entered when the flow transmitter for this
radiation monitor is inoperable. The error was not identified until June 22, 2021.
The database values for this radiation monitor were immediately corrected upon discovery of this condition and operability
was restored on June 22, 2021. For an inoperable WPB Vent Stack High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor, TS
3.3.3.6.c requires the preplanned alternate method of monitoring be implemented within 72 hours and that the inoperable
channel(s) [CHA] be restored to operable status within 7 days or that a Special Report be submitted to the Commission,
pursuant to TS 6.9.2, within the next 14 days. The radiation monitor was found to be inoperable since October 6, 2020,
with none of the TS-prescribed actions occurring.

NARRATIVE
C. Causal Factors
During completion of a surveillance test on this radiation monitor on October 6, 2020, maintenance personnel did not
recognize a note in the Radiation Monitor Data Sheet Library that requires substitute values to be entered when the flow
transmitter for this radiation monitor is inoperable. From investigation, it was identified that the radiation monitoring
surveillance test procedure did not have guidance to compare the as-left database values to the as-found values. It was
also determined that the process for tracking equipment that impacts radiation monitor operability is inadequate. Radiation
Monitoring System (RMS) technicians did not identify this issue until June 22, 2021.
D. Corrective Actions
The database values for this radiation monitor were immediately corrected upon discovery of this condition and operability
was restored on June 22, 2021. Personnel involved with radiation monitor testing and surveillance activities have been
counseled on the expectations and process for verifying equipment status. A shift order instructing RMS technicians to
verify radiation monitor and supporting equipment status with the Main Control Room personnel prior to radiation monitor
database reviews has been issued. A standing order instructing maintenance technicians to compare as-found radiation
monitor database values to as-left values for flow monitors prior to radiation monitor restoration activities has also been
issued. The surveillance test procedure will be revised to incorporate guidance to compare the as-left database values to
the as-found values. An improved process for tracking equipment that impacts radiation monitor operability will be
implemented. The shift order and standing order will remain in effect until the improved process is implemented.
E. Safety Analysis
There were no actual consequences due to this condition prohibited by TS. The WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble
Gas Radiation Monitor provides a monitoring function only and does not initiate any specific control actions or provide an
actuation signal for other components. This monitor does not perform a specific function in mitigating the consequences of
an accident. Alternate means of monitoring conditions in the WPB were available and implemented by the operators for
the duration of this condition. This condition had no impact on the health and safety of the public.
F. Additional Information
There have been no events similar to the event documented in this LER in the past three years.
