On 5/17/2021, the Service Water Pump "A" motor was removed from service for planned maintenance. Following
maintenance, the pump was tested, declared operable, and secured. On 06/02/2021, the pump was placed into service. At
1825, after 11 hours of operation, the Control Room received alarms due to failure of the motor. The circuit breaker had tripped
on instantaneous overcurrent. A standby Service Water Pump was started at 1826 to restore full flow. Locally there was
evidence of motor overheating. The primary plant remained stable throughout the event. The motor was replaced, and Service
Water Pump "A" was restored to operable on 06/05/2021.
It was later determined that the stator had experienced a turn-to-turn short that eventually shorted the coil to ground through
the stator core and to an adjacent phase causing a phase to phase short circuit and subsequent breaker trip. The most likely
cause of the turn-to turn short was a defect in the magnet wire insulation used in the coils during a motor rewind in 2006. The
exact type of latent defect could not be determined; therefore, reasonable assurance of operability of Service Water Pump "A"
could not be established. As a result, the Service Water Pump was inoperable for a duration longer than allowed by Technical
Specifications Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.8 Condition (A) - 14 days. This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)
(2)(i)(B) for a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.

NARRATIVE
I. PRE-EVENT PLANT CONDITIONS
At the time the condition was identified, the plant was in MODE 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power.
II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
A. EVENT
On 5/17/2021, the Service Water Pump "A" motor was removed from service for planned maintenance. Following
maintenance, the pump passed its surveillance test, was declared operable, and was secured. On 06/02/2021, the pump
was placed into service. At 1825, after 11 hours of operation, the Control Room received alarms due to failure of the
Service Water Pump "A" motor. Operators responded to the alarms and, based on Control Room indication of a tripped
pump and lowered pressure in the Service Water loop, started a standby Service Water Pump at 1826, restoring the loop
to normal conditions. It was subsequently determined that the feeder breaker had tripped on instantaneous overcurrent.
Locally, Operators found no active fire but evidence of motor overheating. The primary plant remained stable throughout
the event. The motor was replaced, and Service Water Pump "A" was restored to operable on 06/05/2021.
Based on further investigation, it was later determined that the stator had experienced a turn-to-turn short that eventually
shorted the coil to ground through the stator core and to an adjacent phase causing a phase to phase short circuit and
subsequent breaker trip. The most likely cause of the turn-to-turn short was a defect in the magnet wire insulation used in
the coils during a motor rewind in 2006; however, due to the destruction in the fault area, the exact type of latent defect
could not be determined. Numerous possible contributing causes were evaluated. The original manufacturing defect
likely occurred during rewind and could later have been exacerbated during refurbishment, storage, or testing, as
evidenced by satisfactory service following rewind but a short service life following refurbishment.
Reasonable assurance of operability of Service Water Pump "A" could not be established for the period from 05/17/2021
to 06/02/2021. As a result, the Service Water Pump was inoperable for a period of 19 days, a duration longer than
allowed by Technical Specifications Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.8 Condition (A) - 14 days plus the allowed
Technical Specification Completion Time of 0.25 days, or 14.25 days in total. This duration meets the definition of "Any
operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications" and is reportable under 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).
Actions to prevent recurrence include improving motor repair specifications, evaluating refurbishment frequency,
managing cold/hot starts, and use of motor heaters during storage.
B. INOPERABLE STRUCTURES, COMPONENTS, OR SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT:

C. DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES OF MAJOR OCCURENCES:
For the motor that failed:
02/2006 – last rewind
12/2019 – refurbishment by vendor, then in storage in Ginna Warehouse until installation.
Two (2) weeks prior to installation – surge testing of the motor stator in Ginna Warehouse.
05/17/2021 – Service Water Pump "A" removed from service due to planned maintenance.
05/19/2021 – Service Water Pump "A" returned to service, then secured.
06/02/2021 – Service Water Pump "A" failed during steady state operation after running approximately 11 hours.
D. OTHER SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS AFFECTED:
None
E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY:
Self-revealing: at 1825 on 06/02/2021, Main Control Board alarm L 8 (480V Ground) was received. While dispatching
Equipment Operators to investigate the L 8 alarm, Main Control Board alarms J 9 (Safeguard Breaker Trip) and H 31
(Vacuum Priming System) were received. These Main Control Board alarms were coincident with a Z26 Fire Alarm
(Screenhouse Bus 17, Bus 18, Service Water Pump Area) and the Service Water Pump "A" circuit breaker tripping. The
Fire Brigade dispatched to investigate the Z26 fire alarm found no active fire around the Service Water Pump "A" but
evidence of motor overheating.
F. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES:
No safety systems actuated, which was expected response.
III. CAUSE OF EVENT:
The most likely cause of the stator turn-to turn short (that eventually shorted the coil to ground through the stator core and
then to an adjacent phase to cause a phase to phase short circuit) was a defect in the magnet wire insulation used in the
coils during the motor rewind in 2006. There were possible contributing causes associated with the motor refurbishment
and replacement processes, as noted in Section II.A above.

NARRATIVE
IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE SAFETY CONSEQUENCES OF THE EVENT:
At 1825, the motor failure caused a loss of one of the two running Service Water Pumps. Flow was restored by manually
starting the Service Water Pump "B" at 1826 per the appropriate response procedure which restored SW header pressure
to pre event pressure (70 psig). Service Water loops are normally cross-tied, and the one (1) running Service Water
Pump maintained flow through both loops.
Based on the above considerations and the rapid response by Operations to start and restore normal service water flow to
both loops, this event is not considered to have had any significant effect on the health and safety of the public.
V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The failed motor was removed and replaced to restore operability of Service Water Pump "A" on 06/05/2021.
Procurement and repair strategies will be evaluated for both site processes and vendor oversight of refurbishment. For
the windings, enamel thickness and resin application methods will be optimized to increase motor lifespans. The current
rewind schedule will also be evaluated, and changes made as required. Cold/Hot start strategies will be added to
maintenance and operations procedures, and training enhancements will be made based on learnings from the event.
Lastly, motor heater energization will be added to the storage strategy for Service Water Pump motors and other similarly
stored motors.
VI. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
None
A. FAILED COMPONENTS:
Motor for Service Water Pump “A”
B. PREVIOUS LERs ON SIMILAR EVENTS:
A search of all Ginna LERs submitted to the NRC determined there have been no prior LERs reporting similar motor
failure.
