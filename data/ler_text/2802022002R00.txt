On July 25, 2022, with both Surry Power Station Units 1 and 2 at 100% power, the 7-day Technical Specification (TS) Allowed
Outage Time (AOT) for an emergency diesel generator (EDG) was exceeded due to a partial loss of load during monthly
surveillance testing for the Unit 1 emergency diesel generator (EDG-1), requiring repair and restoration. To complete the
EDG-1 repair, balancing, testing, and return to service, a request for enforcement discretion was submitted and approved that
extended the TS AOT by two days (for a total of nine days). During event troubleshooting, it was revealed that the cause was
corrosion between the lugs of the field lead causing a hard ground on one pole of the generator rotor.
The risk analysis performed for this event concluded that the increase in core damage and large early release probability
remained within the NRC Enforcement Manual, Appendix F limits. Completed corrective actions included the replacement of
the EDG-1 generator and verification of operability of the EDG-2 and EDG-3.

NARRATIVE
PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT
Surry Power Station (SPS) Unit 1 and Unit 2 were at 100% power.
1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
The SPS emergency diesel generator (EDG) [EIIS: DG] for Unit 1 (EDG-1) and Unit 2 EDG (EDG-2) are dedicated to
emergency buses 1H and 2H [EllS: BU], respectively. A third diesel generator (EDG-3) is provided as a "swing diesel"
and is shared by both units (the "J" bus). Each EDG has 100% capacity and is connected to an independent 4160 V
emergency bus. EDG-1 provides emergency power to certain equipment and systems common to Units 1 and 2,
including the Auxiliary Feedwater system (AFW) [EllS: BA] cross-tie between Units 1 and 2, the Auxiliary building [EIIS:
NF] filter exhaust fan [EIIS: FAN], Main Control Room (MCR) [EIIS: NA] chiller [EIIS: CHU], and MCR/Emergency
Switchgear Room [EIIS: EK] filtered supply fans [EllS: FAN].
At 0956 on July 18, 2022, the SPS EDG-1 for Unit 1 was removed from service to perform the monthly surveillance test.
Approximately 20 minutes after reaching full load, EDG-1 experienced a partial loss of load. The MCR operators noted
that the generator load had lowered and the generator output current indication was above the normal amps for fully
loaded. Local field operators noted a change in engine sound normally associated with decreasing load; subsequently,
EDG-1 was unloaded and ran unloaded for 30 minutes before being secured in accordance with the normal shutdown
sequence. Following shutdown, EDG-1 was removed from service for investigation.
Troubleshooting was performed, and it was discovered that a lead to the generator exciter [EIIS: EXC] was grounded. A
physical inspection of this lead revealed a failure between the generator brush rigging and the panel wiring at the bolted
connection point. A bridge and megger check on the generator stator was satisfactory. Further troubleshooting of the
generator rotor indicated a hard ground on one out of eight (8) rotor poles.
It was concluded that repairs to EDG-1 were necessary, including replacement of the generator. During the return-to-
service testing portion of the repair effort, activities required to complete the repair, perform post-maintenance testing, and
return the SPS Unit 1 EDG-1 to service would not be accomplished within the 7-day Allowed Outage Time (AOT)
(reference: TS 3.16.6.1.a.3 for an inoperable EDG), and as such, a request for enforcement discretion was requested
and verbally approved on July 24, 2022, at 14:27. This enforcement discretion allowed a 2-day extension to the 7-day
AOT to complete the EDG-1 return to service activities.
TS 3.16.B.1.a.3 requires an inoperable EDG to be restored to service within seven (7) days or action be initiated to place
the appropriate unit in a shutdown condition. In addition, TS 3.0.2 states that TS action statements associated with any
individual systems, subsystems, trains, components, and devices that EDG-1 supports also would be governed by the 7-
day EDG AOT. Since EDG-1 provides emergency power to certain equipment and systems common to Units 1 and 2, the
shutdown of Unit 2 also would be required upon the expiration of the EDG-1, 7-day AOT.
During final return-to-service testing, at 0956 on July 25, 2022, with both Surry Power Station (SPS) Unit 1 and Unit 2 at
100% power, the AOT for TS 3.16.B.1.a.3 was exceeded for Unit 1. Additionally, TS 3.0.2 for Unit 2 was not satisfied due
to the inoperability of EDG-1 beyond that allowed by TS 3.16.6.1.a.3. Both units remained at 100% power throughout the
restoration of EDG-1 that was declared operable at 1705 on July 26, 2022.

NARRATIVE
2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS
Due to the unavailability of EDG-1, additional Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) calculations were performed to support
the requested enforcement discretion for the additional 48-hour extension of the AOT for TS 3.16. The additional PRA
calculations performed, without compensatory measures included, indicated values of 3.301E-08 for the Incremental
Conditional Core Damage Probability (ICCDP) and 1.967E-09 for Incremental Conditional Large Early Release Probability
(ICLERP), which were below the NRC Enforcement Manual, Appendix F, limits of 5E-7 for ICCDP and 5E-8 for ICLERP.
Additionally, during the period of enforcement, compensatory actions were put in place for defense-in-depth protection.
3.0 CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The EDG-1 was in service for approximately 50 years when the generator failure occurred. A physical inspection of the
field lead disclosed a failure between the generator brush rigging and the panel wiring at the bolted connection point.
Further troubleshooting of the generator rotor indicated a hard ground on one (1) of eight (8) poles. The failure of the lead
caused additional electrical stress on the insulation system of the field that resulted in the first coil on the pole closest to
the field connection to fail to ground. The failed generator was sent to the vendor for failure analysis, and the vendor
confirmed that the field circuit was grounded to the shaft through a grounded pole. From the failure analyses performed, it
was revealed that the cause was corrosion between the lugs of the field lead that led to the hard ground on one pole of the
generator rotor.
4.0 IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION
EDG-1 was declared inoperable and removed from service. In accordance with TS 3.16.B.1.a.2, the EDG-2 and the
swing EDG-3 were successfully run within 24 hours to demonstrate operability and to ensure that the EDGs were not
susceptible to a common cause failure. Additionally, due to EDG-1 providing emergency power to the AFW cross-tie
between Units 1 and 2, TS 3.6.1.3 was entered. Equipment protections were implemented to protect safe shut down
capabilities, and troubleshooting efforts were initiated.
5.0 ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
When the short to ground was discovered on one of the field windings, troubleshooting efforts were suspended in favor of
generator replacement. Compensatory measures were implemented during the extended EDG-1 AOT as specified in the
approved Notice of Enforcement Discretion (NOED). Completed corrective actions include the replacement of the EDG-1
generator, replacement of the field lead and repair of the connection, and inspection of the EDG-3 field leads for corrosion
and heating.
6.0 PLANNED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Planned corrective actions include refurbishment of the failed EDG-1 generator and inspection of the EDG-2 field leads for
corrosion and heating.
