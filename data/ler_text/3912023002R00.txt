16. Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On June 27, 2023 at approximately 1626 Eastern Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), while both units were at 100% rated
thermal power, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 experienced an automatic reactor trip due to a main turbine
trip. All control and shutdown bank rods inserted properly in response to the reactor trip. All safety systems,
including the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System, performed as designed and there were no complications with the
trip.
The most likely cause for the main turbine trip was a loose terminal connection for current input into a main
transformer phase differential trip relay. A design change was implemented to relocate the differential trip signal
such that the one out of two taken twice logic and circuit protection is maintained.
This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as an automatic actuation of the Reactor
Protection System (RPS).

I. Plant Operating Conditions before the Event
Both Watts Bar Units 1 and 2 were at 100 percent Rated Thermal Power (RTP).
II. Description of Event
A. Event Summary
On June 27, 2023 at approximately 1626 Eastern Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), while both
units were at 100% rated thermal power, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 experienced
an automatic reactor trip in response to a main turbine trip. All control and shutdown bank
rods inserted properly in response to the reactor trip. All safety systems, including the
Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[EIIS:BA] System, performed as designed and there were no
complications with the trip. The most probable cause of this event was identified as a loose
connection on the terminal number 4 for B phase current input to the main transformer
differential current relay (287T)[EIIS:87]
Notification to the NRC of the reactor trip was made by Operations at 1904 EDT (Event
Notification number 56593). This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and AFW System.
B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the
event and that contributed to the event
There were no safety related inoperable structures, components, or systems that contributed
to this event.

NARRATIVE
D. Manufacturer and model number of each component that failed during the event
No failed component have been identified at this time.
E. Other systems or secondary functions affected
None.

NARRATIVE
IV. Analysis of the event
While operating at approximately 100% power during steady state operation, the Watts Bar Unit 2
reactor experienced an automatic reactor trip at approximately 1626 EDT on June 27, 2023, in
response to a turbine trip. The turbine trip was caused by an electrical issue which tripped the main
transformer differential current relay 287T. This automatic Unit 2 reactor trip is generally comparable to
the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) description of the Loss of External Electrical Load
and/or Turbine Trip described in the UFSAR Section 15.2.7. The plant response post-trip was
uncomplicated and the plant responded as designed. Operations entered 2-E-0, Reactor Trip or Safety
Injection and subsequently transitioned to 2-ES-0.1, Reactor Trip Response and 2-GO-5, Unit
Shutdown from 30% Reactor Power to Hot Standby..
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
In review of the associated plant system performance data from the key plant parameters and plant
response to the transient it is concluded that all safety systems performed as designed. There were no
conditions identified where actuation signals were not appropriately generated based on the plant
transient. The parameter response for this automatic reactor trip is bounded by the FSAR analyses in
UFSAR Section 15.2.7, “Loss of External Electrical Load and/or Turbine Trip.”
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as
the components and systems that failed during the event
Not applicable.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident
Not applicable.
C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service
Not applicable.

VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
This event was entered into the TVA Corrective Action Program and is being tracked under
Condition Report 1864894.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions
Operations personnel promptly stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Troubleshooting and field
inspections identified the associated loose connection and corrected it.
B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce the probability of similar events
occurring in the future
Design change WBN-23-040 was issued to relocate the 287T differential trip signal from the
252 current transformer (CT) loop to the 251 CT loop through relays RLY-244-S300G3/1 and
2-RLY-244-M3425A/2 such that the one out of two taken twice logic and circuit protection is
maintained. Terminal connection tightness was verified on all other 287T relay current inputs.
Additionally, preventive maintenance change requests are being processed to add wire
termination checks to associated relay calibration activities.
VII. Previous Similar Events at the Same Site
LER 391/2018-003-00 documents a unit trip that occurred on June 22, 2018 due to actuation of
the main transformer differential current relay. The most probable cause of that event was
attributed to an intermittent equipment failure between the neutral side current transformer of the
main generator and the protection relays which led to actuation of the A phase main transformer
differential current relay and subsequent trip.
VIII. Additional Information
None.
IX. Commitments
None.
