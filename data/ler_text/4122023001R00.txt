On April 22, 2023, during the BVPS-2 twenty-third refueling outage (2R23), it was determined that two indications identified on
the reactor pressure vessel head vent line did not meet the applicable acceptance criteria. Because the indications could not be
dispositioned as acceptable per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code Section XI in a Reactor Coolant System
pressure boundary, it was reported under Event Notification 56485 as a degraded condition per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) as a
degraded condition, and is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A).
Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) of the Alloy 600 penetration tube material was determined to be the cause
of the identified flaws. The vent line penetration was repaired in accordance with NB-3200 of ASME Section III, ASME Code
Case N-638-10, and relief request 2-TYP-4-RV-06.

DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) was in a Defueled Mode. There were no systems, structures, or
components that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event.
On April 22, 2023, during the BVPS-2 twenty-third refueling outage (2R23), it was determined that two indications
identified on the reactor pressure vessel head [AB-RPV] vent line did not meet the applicable acceptance criteria. The
reactor pressure vessel head examinations were performed to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D) and
ASME Code Case N-729-6 to find potential flaws/indications before they grow to a size that could potentially jeopardize
the structural integrity of the reactor vessel head pressure boundary.
The eddy current examination results identified one radial linear indication 0.200" long at the 38-degree circumferential
location and one radial linear indication 0.160" long at the 236-degree location.
The degraded condition was reported to the NRC per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) on April 22, 2023 (Event Notification
56485).
CAUSE OF EVENT
Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) of the Alloy 600 penetration tube material was determined to be the
cause of the identified flaws. The failure mechanism is a known issue that is addressed by the requirements of
10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D). The repairs to the vent line penetration were performed in accordance with NB-3200 of ASME
Section III, ASME Code Case N-638-10, and relief request 2-TYP-4-RV-06 and were completed prior to startup.
ANALYSIS OF EVENT
Indications that cannot be dispositioned as acceptable per ASME Code Section XI in a Reactor Coolant System (RCS)
[AB] pressure boundary are reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) as a degraded condition.
The plant risk associated with the BVPS-2 eddy current indications identified on the vent line penetration of the reactor
vessel head is considered to be of very low safety significance. This is based on the fact that the indications were not
through-wall and there was no indication of RCS leakage. The change in core damage frequency derived using the
conditional core damage probability and the change in large early release frequency derived using conditional large early
release probability for the observed condition are very small.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Completed:
The flaws were repaired in accordance with NB-3200 of ASME Section III and ASME Code Case N-638-10 with two
exceptions approved via relief request 2-TYP-4-RV-06. The repair was completed prior to startup in May 2023.
Planned:
The vent line penetration will be examined every outage as required by 10 CFR 50.55a and Code Case N-729-6.
Additional analysis for thermal stress and fatigue will be performed prior to the next refueling outage to confirm the repair
meets ASME fatigue criteria for long term operation. This will be completed per corrective action CA-2023-03587-001.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
Similar reactor vessel head indications were found and repaired during the previous BVPS-2 refueling outages in 2021,
2020, 2018, 2014, 2012, 2009, 2008, and 2006.
