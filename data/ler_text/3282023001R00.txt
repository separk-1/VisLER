On April 11, 2023, with Unit 2 in Mode 5, a surveillance instruction (SI) associated with the ice condenser
intermediate deck doors was completed by Maintenance Services personnel and provided to Operations personnel
for review. Personnel from both groups failed to recognize that the acceptance criteria associated with four ice
condenser intermediate deck doors were not met. At 2035 eastern daylight time, the unit entered a Technical
Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.13 applicable mode, Mode 4, with four inoperable
intermediate deck doors. Because SQN Unit 2 entered an applicable mode without meeting TS LCO 3.6.13, this is a
condition prohibited by TS and is therefore being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), as any
operation or condition which was prohibited by the plants Technical Specifications.
The cause of the event was an error trap in the SI procedure, in that, the acceptance criteria in the SI procedure
were not distinct for the particular door being tested to alert the performer and the reviewer of the acceptable values.
The corrective action was to revise the SI procedure to remove the error trap by listing the specific acceptance
criteria to each door being surveilled.

I. Plant Operating Conditions before the Event
At the time of discovery, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 2 was in Mode 3.
II. Description of Event
A. Event Summary:
On April 11, 2023, with Unit 2 in Mode 5, a surveillance instruction (SI) associated with
Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.13, Ice Condenser Doors, was completed by Maintenance
Services personnel and provided to Operations personnel for review. Personnel from both
groups failed to recognize that the acceptance criteria associated with four ice condenser
[EIIS: BC] intermediate deck doors [EIIS: DR] (the ice condenser has 24 bays, and each bay
has 8 intermediate deck doors) were not met (Door 2 in ice condenser bays 13, 15, 16,
and 17).
On April 14, 2023, at 1130 eastern daylight time (EDT), with the unit in Mode 4, main control
room (MCR) operators were made aware that the acceptance criteria associated with the four
intermediate deck doors were not met. Upon notification, MCR operators entered SQN Unit 2
into TS 3.6.13, Ice Condenser Doors, Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO), Condition B and
completed Required Action B.1 that verifies the maximum ice bed temperature is less than or
equal to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (F). Additionally, MCR operators authorized a conditional
performance of the SI to verify the lifting force of the four intermediate deck doors was
acceptable. At 1446, the acceptance criteria were determined to be met and TS LCO 3.6.13
Condition B was exited.
Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.13.6 requires verification that each intermediate deck door
is free of movement. According to the SR 3.6.13.6 Bases, the intermediate deck door lifting
force for Door 2 should be less than or equal to 33.8 pounds. The SR is applicable in
Modes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
According to LCO 3.0.4, when an LCO is not met, entry into a Mode or other specified
condition in the Applicability shall only be made: a. when the associated Actions to be entered
permit continued operation in the Mode or other specified condition in the Applicability for an
unlimited period of time; b. after performance of a risk assessment addressing inoperable
systems and components, consideration of the results, determination of the acceptability of
entering the Mode or other specified condition in the Applicability, and establishment of risk
management actions, if appropriate (exceptions to this Specification are stated in the
individual Specifications); or c. when an allowance is stated in the individual value, parameter,
or other Specification. Contrary to the above, on April 11 at 2035, the unit entered a

F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error
The SQN NRC Resident Inspector conducted a review of the SI and identified the failed
acceptance criteria. The inspector then notified Operations personnel.
G. The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component
There were no components that failed during the event.
H. Operator actions
Upon notification, MCR operators entered SQN Unit 2 into TS LCO 3.6.13 Condition B and
completed Required Action B.1 that verifies the maximum ice bed temperature is less than or

criteria.
I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses
There were no automatic or manual safety system responses associated with this event.
III. Cause of the event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error
The human performance factors related to this event were procedures and communications.
The acceptance criteria in the SI procedure were not distinct for the particular door being
tested to alert the performer (Maintenance Services) and the reviewer (SRO) of the
acceptable values. Different doors had different acceptance criteria and the procedure could
have better specified the applicable acceptance criteria for each door. The communication
gap was due to the missed hand-off between the performer of the SI and the SRO review for
completeness of information vice a review for accuracy.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause
The cause of the event was an error trap in the SI procedure, in that, the acceptance criteria in
the SI procedure were not distinct for the particular door being tested to alert the performer
and the reviewer of the acceptable values.
Personnel involved were from the Operations and Maintenance Services groups. The
Operations personnel were NRC licensed, TVA employees. The Maintenance Services

personnel were non-licensed supplemental workers. There were no schedule or situational
pressures present.
IV. Analysis of the event
The ice bed consists of a minimum of 1,916,000 pounds of ice stored within the ice condenser.
The primary purpose of the ice bed is to provide a large heat sink in the event of a release of
energy from a design basis accident (DBA) in containment. The ice would absorb energy and
limit containment peak pressure and temperature during the accident transient. Limiting the
pressure and temperature reduces the release of fission product radioactivity from containment to
the environment in the event of a DBA. The ice condenser doors ensure that the ice stored in the
ice bed is preserved during normal operation and that the ice condenser functions as designed if
called upon to act as a passive heat sink following a DBA. In the event of a DBA, the ice
condenser inlet doors (located below the operating deck) open due to the pressure rise in the
lower compartment. This allows air and steam to flow from the lower compartment into the ice
condenser. The resulting pressure increase within the ice condenser causes the intermediate
deck doors and the top deck doors to open, which allows the air to flow out of the ice condenser
into the upper compartment. Steam condensation within the ice condenser limits the
pressure and temperature buildup in containment.
The Unit 2 ice bed remained below 27 degrees F and remained capable of performing its required
safety function to provide a heat sink during a DBA in containment.
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event. There are a total of 192
intermediate deck doors and in this event only four doors were affected. The engineering
procedure associated with Maintenance Rule performance indicator monitoring and reporting
indicates that a functional failure of the ice condenser would require either 25 or more
intermediate deck doors or 7 or more intermediate deck doors within any 24 contiguous doors to
be blocked. Therefore, with only four intermediate deck doors inoperable, the ice condenser
would still have been functional and able to mitigate any DBA.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as
the components and systems that failed during the event
The intermediate deck doors are associated with the ice condenser. With 188 doors operable,
the ice condenser was fully functional during the event.

VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
Corrective Actions are being managed by the TVAs corrective action program under Condition
Report (CR) 1849888.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions
MCR operators verified, through conditional performance of the SI, the lifting force of the four
intermediate deck doors met the acceptance criteria. Additionally, action was taken to
complete TS LCO 3.6.13, Required Action B.1 that verifies the maximum ice bed temperature
is less than or equal to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (F).
B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce the probability of similar events
occurring in the future
The corrective action was to revise the SI procedure to remove the error trap by listing the
specific acceptance criteria to each door being surveilled. Additionally, coaching was provided
to the SI performers as well as the reviewer. Learnings were shared with the Operations peer
team and Maintenance Services via the Nuclear Fleet Learning process.
VII. Previous Similar Events at the Same Site
LER 327 and 328/2021-003 was submitted for exceeding an auxiliary building secondary
containment enclosure (ABSCE) breach margin. The human performance factors related to the
event were associated with the procedure and communications and involved the Maintenance
Services and Operations personnel. The corrective action involved revising the ABSCE breaching
procedure.
