On July 13, 2022 while Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 was operating at 100 percent power, fuel oil intrusion was
identified in the lube oil for emergency diesel generator (EDG) 2-2 following a declining trend in lube oil viscosity. Based on the
fuel intrusion degrading the quality of the lube oil viscosity, it was determined that EDG 2-2 would not be able to meet its mission
time of 30 days and EDG 2-2 was declared inoperable. The lube oil was changed and EDG 2-2 was declared operable on July
16, 2022. The gravity drain from the fuel oil injection pumps to the underground tank was found to have been air bound since the
October 2021 refueling outage, which prevented excess fuel oil from the fuel oil injection pumps from draining back to the fuel oil
storage tank and allowed for intrusion into the lube oil.
The direct cause was a lack of guidance in station procedures to proactively open the gravity drain line vent valve(s) during filling
of the fuel oil storage tank. The root cause was that the organization did not recognize the need to proactively open the gravity
drain line vent valve(s) every time fuel oil is added to the fuel storage tank. Corrective actions include revising the station
procedures used during the fuel oil tank drain and fill activity to provide guidance for venting the gravity drain lines after filling the
tanks. This event is being reported as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) and as a
loss of safety function under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) and (D).

NARRATIVE
Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX].
BACKGROUND
Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) has two separate trains of emergency diesel generators (EDGs) [EK],
both of which are required to be operable in mode 1 by Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1, AC Sources - Operating.
Condition B for one EDG inoperable requires a surveillance to be performed for the operable offsite circuit(s) within 1 hour
and then once every 8 hours, as well as restoration of the EDG to operable status within 72 hours.
Additionally, TS 3.8.1 condition E with two EDGs inoperable requires one to be restored to operable status within 2 hours.
Condition G requires shutdown of the Unit if the Required Action and Completion Time are not met.
The EDG fuel oil injection pumps [DC-P] have a gravity drain to the underground fuel oil storage tank [DE-TK] which
allows excess fuel oil from the pumps to return to the tank. This is routed such that there is an inverted U-shaped section
of the piping which can trap air if drained. A normally closed vent valve is located on this section of pipe to release any
trapped air.
DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
On July 13, 2022, while BVPS-2 was operating at 100 percent power, fuel oil intrusion was identified in the lube oil for
EDG 2-2 following a declining trend in lube oil viscosity. Based on the information available at the time, there was
reasonable assurance that EDG 2-2 would be able to fulfill its safety function and meet its mission time, and a follow-up
operability determination was requested. During the follow-up operability determination, it was determined that EDG 2-2
would not be able to meet its mission time of 30 days based on the fuel oil intrusion degrading the quality of the lube oil,
and EDG 2-2 was declared inoperable on July 13, 2022 at 2055 hours.
During the investigation, the gravity drain from the fuel oil injection pumps to the underground tank was found to be air
bound, which prevented excess fuel oil from the pumps from flowing back to the tank and allowed for intrusion into the
lube oil [LA]. Three of these pumps were replaced and the gravity drain line was vented by opening the vent valve. The air
bound condition existed since the most recent refueling outage in October 2021 following a required surveillance to empty,
clean, and refill the EDG fuel oil storage tanks. Due to the decreasing viscosity of the lube oil as a result of the fuel oil
intrusion, past operability is not supported for the approximate nine months from October 2021 to July 16, 2022.
This condition was identified on the opposite train EDG 2-1 during the outage following a post-maintenance test (PMT)
and corrected, therefore this condition did not exist on EDG 2-1 during the time period since the outage. EDG 2-2 did not
show similar symptoms during its PMT and so was not investigated for a similar condition.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE OF EVENT
The direct cause was a lack of guidance in station procedures to proactively open the gravity drain line vent valve(s). This
resulted in the gravity drain line from EDG 2-2 to the fuel oil tank becoming air bound while being refilled in the October
2021 outage, allowing fuel to build up during operation in the fuel pump push rod cavities until fuel was being introduced to
the engine lube oil, which resulted in a loss of lube oil viscosity to the point where EDG 2-2 was declared inoperable.
The root cause was that the organization did not recognize the need to proactively open the gravity drain line vent valve(s)
each time fuel is added to the fuel oil storage tank.
ANALYSIS OF EVENT
This event is reportable as a condition prohibited by TS per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as EDG 2-2 was inoperable for
approximately nine months. This is also reportable as a loss of safety function under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) and (D) for
the numerous occasions during this period of inoperability that the opposite train EDG was also inoperable for routine
maintenance and testing.
Based on the oil dilution analysis it was determined that the rate of fuel oil intrusion into the lube oil of EDG 2-2 was such
that at the time the issue was identified, the EDG would still have been capable of operating for greater than its PRA
mission time of 24 hours. For the entire period of time over which the identified condition existed, EDG 2-2 remained
capable of running more than long enough to satisfy its PRA success criterion and is considered to have remained fully
available for the PRA. As such, this condition is determined to have no impact on the PRA and is therefore considered to
be of very low safety significance.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Completed:
The EDG 2-2 lube oil was changed, and the air was vented from the gravity drain line to allow for normal drainage.
Follow up lube oil samples were obtained after the oil change and gravity drain venting, and the results confirmed that the
cause of the fuel oil intrusion was corrected.
Planned:
Station procedures used during the fuel oil tank drain and fill activity will be revised to provide guidance for venting the
gravity drain line vent valves after filling the tanks.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
A review of greater than three years found that no similar events have occurred at BVPS.
