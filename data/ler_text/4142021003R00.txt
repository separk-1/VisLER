At 1751 on May 25, 2021, it was determined the local leak rate test (LLRT) for the 2EMF-IN containment
penetration did not meet 10 CFR 50 Appendix J requirements for both the inboard and outboard containment
isolation valves. The LLRT was performed during the C2R24 refueling outage at which time primary
containment was not required to be operable. The leakage assigned to the penetration also resulted in total
containment leakage exceeding the allowed overall leakage (L ). The valves were repaired and retested
a
satisfactorily prior to entering the mode of applicability.
The most likely cause of the leakages from 2MISV5230 and 2MISV5231 is the degradation of the elastomer
seat aggravated by the presence of a buildup of debris in the seating area and overly conservative testing
methodology.
This event was reported to the NRC as an eight-hour, non-emergency Event Notification Number 55275 on May
25, 2021, per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A), “event or condition that the nuclear power plant, including its principal
safety barriers, being seriously degraded”.

Narrative
BACKGROUND
The following information is provided to assist the readers in understanding the event described in this LER.
Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EEIS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets and
Catawba Nuclear Station unique system and component identifiers are contained within parentheses.
On April 15, 2021, with Unit 2 of Catawba Nuclear Station (CNS) at 0 percent power (Mode 6) due to a
refueling outage for cycle 24 (C2R24), the Unit 2 reactor building radiation monitor sample line containment
penetration (2EMF-IN) failed its local leak rate test. The penetration failed to pressurize to the required test
pressure due to excessive leakage through both the inboard and outboard containment isolation valves,
2MISV5231 and 2MISV5230 respectively (Valcor Model 04D-232 1 inch solenoid valves). Due to both primary
containment isolation valves (PCIVs) in this penetration flow path failing to pressurize, a leakage value of L
a
was assigned to each valve, which represents a failure of the associated penetration, 2EMF-IN, to maintain
containment integrity per Technical Specification 3.6.3, Containment Isolation Valves and specifically SR
3.6.3.8, to "Verify the combined leakage rate for all reactor building bypass leakage paths is less than or equal
to 0.07 L when pressurized to greater than or equal to 14.68 psig."
a
Catawba Technical Specification 5.5.2, Containment Leakage Rate Testing Program requires a program shall
be established to implement the leakage rate testing of the containment as required by 10 CFR 50.54(o) and 10
CFR 50, Appendix J, Option B, as modified by approved exemptions. This program shall be in accordance with
the guidelines contained in NEI 94-01, "Industry Guideline for Implementing Performance-Based Option of 10
CFR Part 50, Appendix J," Revision 3-A dated July 2012, and the conditions and limitations specified in NEI 94-
01 Revision 2-A, dated October 2008.
The As-Found LLRT minimum pathway leakage value for any penetration not vented and exposed to
containment pressure during the Integrated Leak Rate Test (ILRT) must be added as a penalty to the results of
the ILRT to obtain the As-Found Overall Integrated Leakage Rate per NEI 94-01, Rev 3A. Due to the failure of
the As-Found local leak rate test for penetration 2EMF-IN and its associated impact on the Containment ILRT,
this event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A), “any event or condition that results in the
condition of the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously degraded” and 10
CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C), “Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of
structures or systems that are needed to control the release of radioactive material.”
EVENT DESCRIPTION
During the scheduled C2R24 refueling outage, a containment integrated leak rate test (ILRT) was performed on
March 30, 2021 with no apparent issues identified. As part of the ILRT, penetration 2EMF-IN was isolated by
closing both containment isolation valves as well as downstream isolation valves. Leakage through this
penetration was not measured during the ILRT as the penetration was to be tested locally and the as found
local leakage measured from this penetration as well as other penetrations isolated for the ILRT would be
added to the Type A containment leakage as prescribed in in NEI 94-01--Rev 3A.

On April 15, 2021, while still in the C2R24 refueling outage, an as found leakage test was performed on
penetration 2EMF-IN. During performance of this test, the penetration was unable to pressurize greater than
11 psig compared to a required test pressure of 15.1 to 15.7 psig. The credited containment isolation valves,
2MISV5231 and 2MISV5230, were tested individually and the penetration would not pressurize utilizing either
valve, indicating gross leakage for each valve. Since the required leak rate could not be measured, a leakage
value equal to L was assigned to each valve, resulting in an as-found overall integrated leakage rate of greater
a
than 1.0 L .
a
After failure of the local leak rate test, repairs were made to valves 2MISV5231 and 2MISV5230 and the
penetration was successfully retested while the unit remained in a mode in which containment integrity is not
required. The result of the completed retest for 2MISV5230 was erroneously entered into the Appendix J
testing database as “As-Found” test data as opposed to “As-Left” data. As stated previously, penetration As-
Found minimum path leak rate data is added to the Type A leakage measured by the ILRT to determine overall
containment leakage. This mis-labeling of the data resulted in the false impression the ILRT initially met all
acceptance criteria as defined in NEI 94-01--Rev 3A-Section 8.0, to which CNS is licensed. This error was
discovered while performing a Maintenance Rule evaluation for the failed penetration after the unit returned to
power operation. Subsequently, all data was reviewed by the Containment/IST engineer and it was concluded
that the penetration did fail the As-Found leakage test. This review confirmed a failure of the As-Found Overall
Integrated Leakage Rate Test.
CAUSAL FACTORS
The most likely cause of the leakages from 2MISV5230 and 2MISV5231 is the degradation of the elastomer
seat aggravated by the presence of a buildup of debris in the seating area. Additionally, the test methodology
which test the valves in a reverse flow direction can contribute to additional leakage. Based on the valves'
design, testing in the reverse flow direction is a worst-case test scenario and reduces closing margin and
seating loads. Testing in this manner is conservative relative to actual valve performance if called upon to
perform its containment isolation function.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Immediate Actions:
1.(cid:9) Repair and retest valves 2MISV5230 and 2MISV5231
Planned Actions:
1. Rebuild and inspect select valves of the same application to determine if this similar O-ring damage
and debris accumulation has occurred in other valves of similar age.
2. Evaluate long term adjustments to the PM (as needed based on action 1 above)
3. Revise LLRT test procedures to include additional troubleshooting actions including testing in the
forward flow direction to provide additional data and to ensure timely communication to Engineering
for review of leak rate test failures.

SAFETY ANALYSIS
Inboard and outboard containment isolation valves 2MISV5231 and 2MISV5230 respectively were found to be
functioning as designed when performing the containment ILRT on March 30, 2021 and these valves have
successfully passed their local leak rate testing requirements each outage for the past eight refueling outages.
In addition, no external leaks in the process piping or components installed in the flow path of these
containment isolation valves was identified. The failure of the valves is determined to have occurred during the
local leak rate test performed on April 15, 2021. This failure occurred in an operating mode where their safety
function of preventing the release of radioactive material from the containment structure was not required and
these valves were repaired and retested satisfactorily prior to entering such an operating mode. There were no
safety consequences for this event as the valves failed in a mode in which the containment isolation function is
not required.
This condition was a safety system functional failure (SSFF) as defined in accordance with NEI 99-02,
“Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guideline.”
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
There have been no previous Licensee Event Reports at Catawba Nuclear Station in the last 3 years with the
same cause as this issue.
