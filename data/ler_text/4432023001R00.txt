Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On April 12, 2023, at 11:07, while in Mode 6 at 0% power, a valid actuation of the ‘B’ Emergency
Diesel Generator (EDG) Emergency Power Sequencer (EPS) occurred due to a loss of power to the
‘B’ train Emergency Bus E6. Troubleshooting determined that the loss of power resulted from spurious
operation of EPS Remote Manual Override (RMO) relays that opened the Unit Auxiliary Transformer
(UAT) feeder breaker to Bus E6. Subsequently, the loss of power to Bus E6 resulted in a valid
actuation of an EPS starting signal to the ‘B’ EDG. On April 15, 2023, Emergency Bus E6 Remote
Manual Override relays were tested and all functions were found to operate as designed. At the time of
this event, the ‘B’ EDG was removed from service for scheduled maintenance and therefore, did not
start. There was minimal impact to the station due the unplanned actuation. However, based on the
fact that the ’B’ EDG did not actually start, this event had no impact on to the health and safety of the
public. In addition, there were no other Structure Systems or Components (SSCs) that contributed to
this event.

Narrative
Description
On April 12, 2023, at 11:07, while in Mode 6 at 0% power, a valid actuation of the ‘B’ Emergency
Diesel Generator (EDG) Emergency Power Sequencer (EPS) occurred due to a loss of power to the
‘B’ train Emergency Bus E6.
Cause of the Event
Complex troubleshooting was performed in accordance with station processes. All potential faults
were analyzed utilizing a Support Refute Matrix. Potential faults included:
1. Undervoltage Control Circuit Failures (refuted)
2. Actual undervoltage condition on Bus E6 (refuted)
3. Human Performance issues (refuted)
4. Faulty Bus E6 Breaker Protection (refuted)
5. EPS Power Supply Interactions (refuted)
6. Spurious Remote Manual Override Actuation (cause of event)
7. EPS Power Supplies (contributor to event)
Spurious actuation of the EPS Remote Manual Override (RMO) relays resulted in opening of the Unit
Auxiliary Transformer feeder breaker to Bus E6. This caused a loss of power to Bus E6, which
resulted in the valid actuation of the EPS. The spurious actuation of RMO was most likely caused by
welding activities being performed in the B Train Essential Switchgear Room. A contributing cause is
age related degradation of the B EPS Power Supplies. The electrolytic capacitors were at the end of
their service life making the power supplies more susceptible to conducted emissions that were
introduced on ground as a result of a welding activity.
Analysis of the Event
This licensee event report is being submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), Valid
System Actuation.
This event did not result in a Safety System Functional Failure.
Safety Significance
At the time of this event, the ‘B’ EDG was removed from service for scheduled maintenance and
therefore, did not start. The station was in a defueled condition with all fuel in the Spent Fuel Pool.
Spent fuel pool cooling was not impacted by the event. The unexpected actuation did result in minimal
impact to the station. However, since the EDG was removed from service and did not acuate, this
event had no impact on the health and safety of the public. In addition, there were no other Structures
Systems or Components (SSCs) that contributed to this event.

Corrective Actions
On April 15, 2023, testing of the EPS RMO relays was performed, and all components were found to
operate as designed. In addition, the EPS power supplies were replaced on April 17, 2023.
