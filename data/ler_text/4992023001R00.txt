On November 5, 2023, at 2200 hours, Train B Essential Chilled Water System was declared INOPERABLE for planned
maintenance. On November 16, 2023, at 1541, Train C Essential Chilled Water System was declared INOPERABLE due to an
unexpected material condition causing Train C Essential Chiller to trip. This condition resulted in the inoperability of two of three
safety trains (B and C) required for accident mitigating function including: High Head Safety Injection (HHSI), Low Head Safety
Injection (LHSI), Containment Spray, Control Room Envelope (CRE) HVAC, and Essential Chilled Water. Train A Essential
Chilled Water System remained operable and in-service for the duration of the event.
The condition was determined to be reportable per 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented the
fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
A failed relay in a Train C Essential Chilled Water System control panel experienced infant mortality, causing the Train C
Essential Chiller to trip and be declared INOPERABLE. Completed corrective actions include completion of Train B Essential
Chilled Water System planned maintenance on November 17, 2023, and corrective maintenance to replace a failed relay and
blown fuse on the Train C Essential Chiller local control panel.

NARRATIVE
I. Description of Reportable Event
A. Reportable Event Classification
This event is reportable pursuant to 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) because the South Texas Project (STP) Design Basis
Document (DBD) for the Essential Chilled Water System states that the system provides cooling water to the safety-
related Air Handler Unit (AHU) for the Control Room Envelope (CRE) during normal and accident conditions. The CRE
HVAC system DBD states that two of the three essential chilled water system trains are needed to maintain the CRE
HVAC safety function requirements in the event of a Safety Injection (SI) signal. With only one of three Essential Chilled
Water system trains operable from 1541 on November 16, 2023, to 1702 on November 18, 2023, the CRE HVAC system
may have not been able to meet all safety function requirements in the event of an accident.
B. Plant Operating Conditions Prior to Event
Prior to the event, STP Unit 2 was at 100% power in Mode 1.
C. Status of Structures, Systems, and Components That Were Inoperable at the Start of the Event and That Contributed
to the Event
The Unit 2 Essential Chilled Water system Train B and cascading systems were INOPERABLE due to planned
maintenance when the Train C Essential Chilled Water system was declared INOPERABLE due to a material condition.
No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of the event or contributed to the event.

NARRATIVE
11/16/23 (1455) - Operations started Train C Essential Chiller 22C
11/16/23 (1541) - Train C Essential Chiller tripped and Train C Essential Chilled Water system declared INOPERABLE
and non-functional. Entered TS 3.7.14, Action B for Trains B and C Essential Chilled Water systems and TS 3.7.7, Action
C for Trains B and C CRE HVAC. TS 3.7.7, Action C requires restoration of two control room makeup and cleanup
filtration systems to OPERABLE status within 72 hours, or be in at least Hot Standby within the next six hours and in Cold
Shutdown within the following 30 hours. TS 3.7.7 allowed completion time was 11/19/23 at 1541.
11/17/23 (0241) - Operations attempted to start Train C Essential Chiller 22C in support of troubleshooting maintenance.
The breaker did not close, and locally at the chiller the oil pump did not start. No relays changed state.
11/18/23 (1010) - Operations started Train B Essential Chiller 22B for maintenance testing.
11/18/23 (1345) - Operations declared Train B Essential Chiller 22B Functional, placed in standby for breaker continuity
testing.
11/18/23 (1702) - Operations declared Train B Essential Chiller 22B OPERABLE, exiting TS 3.7.7, Action C and TS
3.7.14, Action B. The equipment condition at this time, with Trains A and B Essential Chilled Water systems OPERABLE,
ensured that CRE HVAC system would be able to meet all safety function requirements in the event of an accident, as
described in the CRE HVAC Design Basis Document.
E. Method of Discovery
The inoperability of two of three Essential Chilled Water systems was self-revealing as it was discovered when Train B
Essential Chiller was INOPERABLE for planned maintenance and Train C Essential Chiller 22C tripped when placed in
service.
II. Component Failures
A. Failure Mode, Mechanism, and Effects of Failed Components
The failed component in this event was Relay 3R in the Train C Essential Chiller 22C Local Control Panel (C1CHZLP625).
After Train C Essential Chiller 22C tripped, an operator investigating the trip noted an acrid oder in the vicinity of the
chiller. The resistance reading across the failed 3R relay coil was 4.44E+6 ohms when typical measurements for relays
should be approximately 50-200 ohms. Relay 3R has the function of energizing and de-energizing to automatically start
and stop the chiller compressor. Failure of this relay resulted in failure to start the chiller compressor.
B. Cause of Component Failure
The cause of the component failure was a short circuit that caused an overcurrent. This increased ohmic heating of the
relay, causing a blown fuse and the relay coil to open. The relay is replaced on a 780-week frequency and this particular
relay failed within 15 months (less than 60 weeks) following installation. It was determined the relay experienced infant
mortality.

II. Analysis of Event
A. Safety System Responses that Occurred
No safety system responses occurred because of this event.
B. Duration of Safety System Inoperability
Trains B and C of the Essential Chilled Water System were INOPERABLE from 1541 on November 16, 2023, to 1702 on
November 18, 2023, when Train B Essential Chilled Water System was declared OPERABLE. This was a total of 49 hours
and 21 minutes.
C. Safety Consequences and Implications
The risk evaluation estimated the incremental core damage probability (ICDP) and the incremental large early release
probability (ILERP) associated with this condition using RICTCaI/RAsCaI software. The calculated ICDP and ILERP are
above the Non-Risk Significant Threshold but below the Potentially Risk Significant Threshold. The requirements of the
Risk Managed Technical Specification (RMTS) program were met and documented.
The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase in offsite dose rates. There were no personnel
injuries or damage to any other safety-related equipment associated with this event.
Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.
