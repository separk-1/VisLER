On August 28, 2022, at 03:29 Eastern Daylight Time, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), in Mode 1 at 100
percent power, the reactor was manually tripped in response to an automatic trip of the “B” main feedwater pump (MFP) caused
by a trip of the “B” condensate pump (CP). The “B” CP tripped following an electrical failure of its motor. The trip of the “B” CP
resulted in subsequent trips of the “B” condensate booster pump and the “B” MFP as designed. In accordance with plant
procedures, the operations crew manually tripped the reactor upon the trip of a MFP with initial reactor power greater than 90
percent. The “A” MFP tripped shortly after the manual reactor trip due to a low suction pressure condition created from the
condensate and feedwater transient. The auxiliary feedwater pumps auto-started on low steam generator level as designed.
Safety systems functioned as required. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public.
The “B” CP motor electrical failure was caused by a lightning strike. The design of CP motors and associated surge protection
did not prevent motor damage and failure from a lightning strike. The “B” CP motor was replaced. The “A” CP and “B” CP motor
surge protectors were inspected and tested, with no deficiencies identified. A study will be completed to determine changes
needed to prevent future lightning induced failures of the CP motors.

Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets [].
A. Background
Prior to the event, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100
percent power. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the time of this event that
contributed to the event. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as “Any event or condition that resulted in
manual actuation or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of [10 CFR 50.73]...” due to
actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JC] and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) [BA]. All actuated safety
systems functioned as designed.
The HNP condensate system [SD] and feedwater system [SJ] design includes two redundant trains each with a
condensate pump (CP) [SD P], a condensate booster pump (CBP), and a main feedwater pump (MFP) [SJ P]. The CPs
take suction from the main condenser [COND] hotwell. The discharge from both CPs combine and flow to the suction of
both CBPs. The discharge of the CBPs flow through a series of feedwater heaters [ SJ HX] and combines with the
discharge of the heater drain pumps [SN P] to provide suction to the two MFPs. The MFPs discharge flow through two
additional feedwater heaters, and then the flow is separated into three lines to provide inventory to the three steam
generators [SGs]. The HNP condensate system and feedwater system design results in a trip of the associated CBP and
MFP following a CP trip when both MFPs are in service.
B. Event Description
On August 28, 2022, at 03:29 Eastern Daylight Time, the reactor was manually tripped in response to an automatic trip of
the “B” MFP caused by a trip of the “B” CP. The “B” CP tripped following an electrical failure of its motor. The “B” CP motor
is a 6.6 kilovolt motor manufactured by Siemens-Allis, serial number 1-5017-10368-1-1. The trip of the “B” CP resulted in
subsequent trips of the “B” CBP and the “B” MFP as designed. In accordance with plant procedures, the operations crew
manually tripped the reactor upon the trip of a MFP with initial reactor power greater than 90 percent. The “A” MFP tripped
shortly after the manual reactor trip due to a low suction pressure condition created from the condensate and feedwater
transient. The AFWS pumps auto-started on low steam generator level as designed. Safety systems functioned as
required.
C. Causal Factors
The “B” CP motor electrical failure was caused by a lightning strike. The design of CP motors and associated surge
protection did not prevent motor damage and failure from a lightning strike.
D. Corrective Actions
The “B” CP motor was replaced. The “A” CP and “B” CP motor surge protectors were inspected and tested, with no
deficiencies identified. A study will be completed to determine changes needed to prevent future lightning induced failures
of the CP motors. Necessary changes identified by this study will be implemented.

E. Safety Analysis
The manual reactor trip had no impact on public health and safety. The reactor was manually tripped by control room
operators as directed by plant procedures. The plant is designed for a loss of main feedwater and plant systems
responded as expected for this condition. The condition did not result in a safety system functional failure and had no
adverse impact on the health and safety of the public.
F. Additional Information
There have been no events at HNP similar to the event documented in this LER in the past three years.
