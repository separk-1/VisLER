On April 2, 2023, at 0341, Operations entered the Senior Reactor Operator Decision Making Process after
receiving a report that called into question the functionality of the operating 2B Main Feedwater (MFW) Pump
Recirculation Valve, 2CF-81. At the time, Unit 2 was in Mode 3, the 2B MFW pump was feeding the steam
generators, and the 2A MFW Pump Recirculation Valve 2CF-76 was nonfunctional. At 0352 hours, Operations
manually started the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Motor Driven Pumps to feed the steam generators to allow
corrective maintenance on the MFW System. The AFW Motor Driven Pumps started as designed. Flow to the
steam generators was not adversely impacted during this sequence.
Subsequent investigation determined that the 2A and 2B MFW recirculation piping experienced abnormal vibration
when flow was introduced through valves 2CF-76 and 2CF-81, making the valves susceptible to failure. The
recirculation piping had recently been modified to replace the carbon steel elbow piping immediately downstream
of the valves with a stainless steel target tee configuration. To mitigate the issue, the target tee was replaced with
the original carbon steel elbow arrangement. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public.

BACKGROUND
The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER.
Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets.
Feedwater System [SJ]:
The Main Feedwater System (MFW) takes treated Condensate System water, heats it further to improve the
plant's thermal cycle efficiency, and delivers it at the required flow rate, pressure, and temperature to the
steam generators (SGs). The MFW is designed to maintain proper vessel water levels with respect to reactor
power output and turbine steam requirements.
Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA]:
The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically supplies feedwater to the SGs to remove decay heat
from the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) upon the loss of normal feedwater supply. The AFW mitigates the
consequences of any event with loss of normal feedwater. The design basis of the AFW is to supply water to
the SGs to remove decay heat and other residual heat by delivering at least the minimum required flow rate
to the SGs.
The AFW is designed to start automatically for any event requiring emergency feedwater. The AFW Motor
Driven Pumps will automatically provide feedwater when initiated on any of the following conditions:
1. Trip of both main feedwater pumps
2. AMSAC Actuation (AMSAC - Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) Mitigation System Activation
Circuitry)
3. Two out of four (2/4) low-low level alarms in any one SG
4. Initiation of a safety injection signal
5. Loss of power to the 4160V essential bus (Blackout)
The AFW Turbine Driven Pump will automatically provide feedwater when initiated on any of the following
conditions:
1. Two out of four (2/4) low-low level alarms in any two SGs
2. Loss of power to the 4160V essential bus (Blackout)
3. 1/1 detector from Standby Shutdown Facility (SSF) SG Wide Range Low-Low Level on 2/4 SGs (72%)

EVENT DESCRIPTION
On April 1, 2023, McGuire Unit 2 was preparing to exit the 2023 spring refueling outage by entering Mode 3
and subsequently heating the Reactor Coolant System to full temperature and pressure. During the refueling
outage and prior to plant heat up, an Engineering Change (EC 419577) was implemented to (1) replace the
piping downstream of the MFW Pump Recirculation Valves 2CF-76 and 2CF-81 with stainless steel material,
(2) replace the elbow immediately downstream of valves 2CF-76 and 2CF-81 with a “target tee”
configuration, and (3) upgrade the pressure and temperature ratings of piping between 2CF-76/81 and 2CF-
77/82. Subsequently, during MFW pump startup activities after completion of the modification, the 2A and
213 MFW recirculation piping experienced abnormal vibration when flow was introduced through the
recirculation valves.
On April 2, 2023, at 0341, Operations entered the Senior Reactor Operator Decision Making Process after
receiving a report that called into question the functionality of the operating 213 MFW Pump Recirculation
Valve, 2CF-81. At the time, Unit 2 was in Mode 3, the 213 MFW pump was feeding the steam generators, and
the 2A MFW Pump Recirculation Valve 2CF-76 was nonfunctional. At 0352 hours, Operations manually
started the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Motor Driven Pumps to feed the steam generators to allow corrective
maintenance on the MFW System. The AFW Motor Driven Pumps started as designed. Flow to the steam
generators was not adversely impacted during this sequence.
Subsequent investigation determined that turbulent flow through the target tee caused abnormal vibration,
making the recirculation valves susceptible to failure. As a means of mitigating the issue, the Engineering
Change was revised to return the outlet configuration of 2CF-76 and 2CF-81 back to its original short radius
elbow configuration of schedule 80 carbon steel. After completion of the Engineering Change revision, the
MFW pumps were successfully restarted, vibration levels were consistent with normal operation, and the
recirculation valves functioned as required. The 2A and 213 AFW Motor Driven Pumps were secured, and
unit startup activities continued.
Sequence of Events (times are approximate)
• 04/01/23 12:16 – Unit 2 entered Mode 3
• 04/02/23 00:42 – The Unit 2 Reactor Coolant System reached full temperature and pressure.

NARRATIVE
• 04/02/23 04:03 – The 2B MFW pump was removed from service by the control room.
• 04/02/23 04:05 – The Unit 2 AFW Motor Driven Pumps are providing feed flow to all Unit 2 steam
generators.
• 04/03/23 23:24 – The 2B MFW pump was placed back into service.
• 04/03/23 23:28 – The control room secured the 2A and 2B AFW Motor Driven Pumps.
• 04/04/23 21:10 – The 2A MFW pump was placed back into service.
REPORTABILITY DETERMINATION
Manual actuation of the AFW Motor Driven Pumps meets the threshold for an 8-hour report in accordance
with § 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), “Any event or condition that results in valid actuation of any of the systems listed in
paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, except when the actuation results from and is part of a pre-planned
sequence during testing or reactor operation.” § 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(B) lists the AFW System as a system within
the scope of § 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A).
On April 2, 2023, at 1129, Operations reported the manual actuation of the AFW Motor Driven Pumps to the
NRC Operations Center as a valid actuation in accordance with § 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). The Event Notification
(EN) is documented as EN 56451.
This LER satisfies the corresponding written reporting criteria in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or
condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph
(a)(2)(iv)(B).”
CAUSAL FACTORS
A cause investigation determined that the risk of an adverse impact, due to an unvalidated design
assumption on turbulent flow, was not recognized when modifying the MFW pump recirculation lines.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The previously implemented Engineering Change was revised to return the plant to its former configuration
by replacing the newly installed target tees with schedule 80 carbon steel short radius elbows. Engineering
Change procedural guidance was also revised to require risk assessments for First-Of-A-Kind (FOAK) or
First-In-A-While (FIAW) plant modifications.

SAFETY ANALYSIS
Operations manually started the AFW Motor Driven Pumps prior to removing the 2B MFW pump from
service. The AFW Motor Driven Pumps started as designed, and feed flow to the steam generators was not
adversely impacted during this event. All plant systems responded as expected. Therefore, it is concluded
that the impact on core damage risk was very small, and the event had no impact on public health and
safety.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
A review(cid:9) of previous Licensee Event Reports was conducted to determine if this was a recurring event (i.e.,
similar event with the same cause or same failure mode). No previous similar events were identified within
the past three years associated with manual actuation of the AFW System. Therefore, this is not considered
a recurring event.
