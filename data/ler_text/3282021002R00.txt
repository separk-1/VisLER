On October 28, 2021, Main Steam Throttle Valve 1 (TV-1), associated with the high-pressure turbine and turbine
trip function, was replaced during the Unit 2 refueling outage. On November 5, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9
was successfully completed for the Turbine Trip function. On November 8, at 2115 eastern standard time (EST),
during turbine overspeed trip testing, it was identified that TV-1 took longer than expected to close on the
overspeed trip signal. In response, station personnel developed a support/refute matrix that included validating
installation of an orifice block vice a flushing block in TV-1. This led to the discovery that TV-1 was installed with
the incorrect block. The flushing block was replaced with the correct orifice block. On November 9, at 0700,
SR 3.3.2.9 was successfully completed restoring the valve to operable status.
The cause of the event was the failure to follow procedural requirements regarding a quality critical maintenance
(QCM) step. The maintenance procedure addressing quality critical maintenance requires that
supervision/oversight must be present in the field during the execution of steps requiring additional oversight.
Contrary to this requirement, The TVA QCM signee performed the step in an independent verification role vice
providing oversight and witnessing the installation of the correct orifice plate. Corrective actions included providing
a briefing for Outage Services personnel regarding oversight responsibilities associated with QCM steps and
revising the vendor's procedure "Critical Step" with photos and guidance to visually confirm and photograph blocks
when installing.

NARRATIVE
I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event
At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at approximately
15 percent rated thermal power.
II. Description of Event
A.(cid:9) Event Summary:
On October 28, 2021, Main Steam [EIIS: SB] Throttle Valve-1 (TV-1) [EIIS: SCV], associated
with the high-pressure turbine [EIIS: TRB] and turbine trip [EMS: JJ] function, was replaced
during the Unit 2 refueling outage. On November 5, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 (Verify
ESFAS [Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System] RESPONSE TIMES are within limit)
was successfully completed for the Turbine Trip function.
On November 8, at 2115 eastern standard time (EST), during turbine overspeed trip testing, it was
identified that TV-1 took longer than expected to close on the overspeed trip signal. During
subsequent testing, TV-1 continued to close slower than expected. In response, station personnel
developed a support/refute matrix that included validating installation of an orifice block vice a
flushing block in TV-1. This led to the discovery that TV-1 was installed with the incorrect block.
The flushing block was replaced with the correct orifice block.
On November 9, at 0700, SR 3.3.2.9 was successfully completed restoring the valve to
operable status. At 0745 a partial performance of turbine overspeed testing confirmed TV-1
was functioning as required.
During the Unit 2 refueling outage, TV-1 was one of several turbine control system valves
replaced. Valves received from the vendor typically arrive with flushing blocks installed and
are clearly labeled as such. Two of the replacement valves were received with labeled flushing
blocks attached. TV-1 was received from the vendor without a labeled flushing block that
appeared to be and was assumed to be the required orifice block for the valve. Total reliance
was placed on the vendor method for labeling flushing blocks.
The delta in closing times between the November 5th ESFAS testing and the November 8th
turbine overspeed testing is most probably the result of different system alignments during the
tests. During the performance of ESFAS testing, the four main steam throttle valves are
manipulated with the governor valves remaining closed and isolated from the Electrohydraulic
Control (EHC) System. Whereas, during the performance of turbine overspeed trip testing, all
the throttle valves and governor valves are manipulated. It is possible that additional flow in
the EHC trip header, due to flow from the additional valves, could cause increased
backpressure on the throttle drain to the trip header. With the flushing block installed on TV-1
rather than the required orifice, it is possible the backpressure on TV-1 could reduce the
effectiveness of draining EH fluid to the trip header. This reduced flow would in turn slow the
response of TV-1 to close. A condition report (CR) was initiated to evaluate if the system

alignment for surveillance testing and turbine overspeed testing should be similar.
A past operability evaluation (POE) determined TV-1 was inoperable from Mode 3 entry on
November 5, 2021, at 0519 until November 9, 2021, at 0700, when turbine trip response time
testing was completed with acceptance criteria met. Therefore, this event is reportable per
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's
technical specifications. Additionally, the POE determined the turbine trip function requires
four out of four throttle valves to close, and with TV-1 inoperable, the turbine trip function would
not have been performed within the required 2.5 seconds (per the Final Safety Analysis Report
(FSAR)). This constitutes an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a
safety function necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident, which is reportable
under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).

IV. Analysis of the Event:
The primary functions of the Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation signals are to prevent damage to
the turbine due to water in the steam lines, and to stop the excessive flow of feedwater into the
steam generators (SGs). These Functions are necessary to mitigate the effects of a high-water
level in the SGs, which could result in carryover of water into the steam lines and excessive
cooldown of the primary system. Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation functions must be operable
in Modes 1, 2, and 3 except when all main feedwater (MFW) isolation valves (MFIVs), MFW
regulation valves (MFRVs), and associated MFRV bypass valves are closed or isolated by a closed
manual valve when the MFW System is in operation and the turbine generator may be in operation.
Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation is also initiated by all Functions that initiate a Safety Injection
(SI) signal.
Turbine trip is a required part of ESFAS as outlined in TS 3.3.2. The response time testing
requirement for turbine trip is 2.5 seconds per the FSAR. TS 3.3.2 requires that the throttle valves
close in 1.1 seconds (SR 3.3.2.9) so that, when combined with the other trip logic in a turbine trip
signal, the overall response time testing requirement is met. The turbine trip function requires four-
out-of-four throttle valves to close.
While the turbine was latched, the main turbine governor valves were available to remove steam
flow from the main turbine. These valves function as a series valve to the throttle valves and
receive the same trip signal that is supplied to the throttle valves. These valves are not response
time tested, but at the time of this event, were all functioning correctly which includes tripping
closed in a similar time to the throttle valve's design time. Additionally, there was no challenge with
the Feedwater Isolation function or MSIVs. With the MSIVs available, the capability existed to
mitigate a cooldown event by isolating all steam supplied from the reactor to the secondary plant.
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no actual safety consequences because of this event. With TV-1 inoperable, there
were additional methods to stop steam flow to the main turbine. One is by closure of the main
turbine governor valves, and another, is closure of the MSIVs. In the event a turbine overspeed
event occurred and turbine "missiles" released, the projected paths would not have been
expected to damage the main control room or key safety related systems. A probabilistic risk
assessment determined that increase to risk for Core Damage Frequency or Large Early Release
Frequency is very small.
A.(cid:9) Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the
components and systems that failed during the event:
With TV-1 inoperable, there were additional methods to stop steam flow to the main turbine,
closure of the main turbine governor valves, and another, closure of the MSIVs.

B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident:
The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down.
C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service:
Operators documented the slow closure of TV-1 on November 8 at 2115. The valve was
returned to operable status on November 9 at 0700. The elapsed time was 9 hours
45 minutes.
VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP)
under CRs 1734714 and 1734963.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions:
