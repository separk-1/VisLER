On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time, during power descension for the upcoming Unit 1 refueling
outage, main control room operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this
time, Main Steam Throttle Valve 2 (TV-2), associated with the high-pressure turbine and turbine trip function failed
to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to
travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a
closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in
steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other
turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. TV-2 was inoperable from October 22,
2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability.
Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as to why the valve
failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure analysis, the most likely cause of
valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve components. The valve and the associated actuator were
replaced to correct the condition. Once the failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective
action program to address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.

NARRATIVE
I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event
At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately
24 percent rated thermal power preparing for a refueling outage.
II. Description of Event
A. Event Summary:
On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time (EDT), during power descension for the
upcoming refueling outage, main control room (MCR) operators initiated a manual turbine trip
in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam [EIIS: SB] Throttle Valve-2
(TV-2) [EIIS: FCV], associated with the high-pressure turbine [EIIS: TRB] and turbine trip
[EIIS: JJ] function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its
own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions
taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam
dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump
demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all
other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped.
After the turbine trip was initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested,
the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) closed as expected with no challenges. This
demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV operability was
challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2.
TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during the refueling outage.
A past operability evaluation (POE) determined TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022,
at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. The POE determined the
turbine trip function requires four out of four throttle valves to close, and with TV-2 inoperable,
the turbine trip function would not have been performed within the required 2.5 seconds (per
the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR)). Therefore, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 (Verify
ESFAS [Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System] RESPONSE TIMES are within limit)
would not have been met. This constitutes an event or condition that could have prevented the
fulfillment of a safety function necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident, which is
reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).
B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event
and contributed to the event:
No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event.

III. Cause of the Event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error:
Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as
to why the valve failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure
analysis, the most likely cause of valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve
components.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause:
There were no human performance related causes.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the Event:
The primary functions of the Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation signals are to prevent damage to
the turbine due to water in the steam lines, and to stop the excessive flow of feedwater into the
steam generators (SGs). These Functions are necessary to mitigate the effects of a high-water
level in the SGs, which could result in carryover of water into the steam lines and excessive
cooldown of the primary system. Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation functions must be operable
in Modes 1, 2, and 3 except when all main feedwater (MFW) isolation valves (MFIVs), MFW
regulation valves (MFRVs), and associated MFRV bypass valves are closed or isolated by a closed
manual valve when the MFW System is in operation and the turbine generator may be in operation.
Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation is also initiated by all Functions that initiate a Safety Injection
(SI) signal.
Turbine trip is a required part of ESFAS as outlined in TS 3.3.2. The response time testing
requirement for turbine trip is 2.5 seconds per the FSAR. TS 3.3.2 requires that the throttle valves
close in 1.1 seconds (SR 3.3.2.9) so that, when combined with the other trip logic in a turbine trip
signal, the overall response time testing requirement is met. The turbine trip function requires four-
out-of-four throttle valves to close.
During the period of inoperability, the main turbine governor valves were closed and thus also
functioning to remove steam flow from the main turbine. These valves function as a series valve to
the throttle valves and receive the same trip signal that is supplied to the throttle valves. These
valves are not response time tested, but at the time of this event, were all functioning correctly
which includes tripping closed in a similar time to the throttle valvesโ design time. Additionally, there
was no challenge with the Feedwater Isolation function or MSIVs. With the MSIVs available, the
capability existed to mitigate a cooldown event by isolating all steam supplied from the reactor to
the secondary plant.

V.(cid:9) Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no actual safety consequences because of this event. After the turbine trip was
initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested, the MSIVs closed with no
challenges. This demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV
operability was challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2. A probabilistic risk
assessment determined that increase to risk for Core Damage Frequency or Large Early Release
Frequency was considered negligible.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the
components and systems that failed during the event:
With TV-2 inoperable, there were additional methods to stop steam flow to the main turbine,
closure of the main turbine governor valves, and another, closure of the MSIVs.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident:
The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down.
C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service:
TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the
Mode of Applicability.
VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP)
under Condition Report 1811241.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions:
TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during refueling outage.
B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring
in the future:
The valve and the associated actuator were replaced to correct the condition. Once the
failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective action program to
address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.
