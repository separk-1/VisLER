On March 18, 2023, at 0933, during the shutdown of Unit 1 reactor for 1RE24, while in Mode 4 and performing
surveillance procedure steps for Pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valve (PORV) PCV-0656A, the valve failed to
open. The surveillance was successfully reperformed later that shift and the valve was declared operable. The
capability of the PORV to meet its design function for manual control of RCS pressure if it had been called upon to
perform its safety functions from 11/3/2021 to 3/18/2023, was not assured. Therefore, PORV 0656A was
considered to have been inoperable during this time. On 1/4/2023, from 0757 until 1431, the PORVs could not
have fulfilled their safety function for manual control of RCS pressure under postulated design basis conditions,
because the second PORV 0655A was unavailable due to scheduled maintenance. The event was determined to
be reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications and per 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. The cause of the event
was determined to be inadequate guidance in the PORV maintenance procedure and inadequate implementation
of a design change package. Corrective actions include revising and updating procedures and documentation.

NARRATIVE
I. Description of Event
A. Reportable Event Classification
This event is reportable per 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specification and per 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)
as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function.
Reporting Criterion 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) is “Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plants Technical
Specifications except when: (1) The Technical Specification is administrative in nature; (2) The event consisted solely of a
case of a late surveillance test where the oversight was corrected, the test was performed, and the equipment was found to
be capable of performing its specified safety functions; or (3) The Technical Specification was revised prior to discovery of
the event such that the operation or condition was no longer prohibited at the time of discovery of the event.”
The Technical Specification action statement for an inoperable PORV due to excessive seat leakage allows continued
operation with the associated block closed because manual operation of the PORV is still available. In contrast, the action
statement for a PORV inoperable for reasons other than excessive seat leakage states: “restore the PORV to OPERABLE
status or close the associated block valve and remove power from the block valve; within the following 72 hours restore the
PORV to OPERABLE status” ... “or be in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours and in HOT SHUTDOWN within the
following 6 hours.” In this event, the plant operated throughout the entire duration of Cycle 24 with PCV-0656A most likely
not capable of meeting design requirements. This period exceeds the 72-hour allowed outage time of Technical
Specification 3.4.4 Limiting Condition for Operations Action (b) for a PORV inoperable due to causes other than excessive
seat leakage. Therefore, this event is considered reportable per 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical
Specifications.
Reporting Criterion 50.73(a)(2)(v) is “Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function
of structures or systems that are needed to: (A) Shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B)
Remove residual heat; (C) Control the release of radioactive material; or (D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.”
Only one pressurizer PORV is required for RCS pressure control to reach safe shutdown or to mitigate the consequences
of a steam generator tube rupture. Pressurizer PORV PCV-0655A never experienced excessive seat leakage during Cycle
24. Plant computer data and Unit 1 control room logs were reviewed for the duration of Cycle 24 to identify any periods
when PCV-0655A was declared inoperable. From January 4, 2023, at 0750 until January 5, 2023, at 0415, the 125 Volt DC
Bus which is the power supply for PCV-0655A was inoperable for surveillance testing. On January 4, 2023, a performance
discharge test was performed on the 125 Volt DC Bus in accordance surveillance procedures. During the surveillance, the
125 Volt DC Bus breaker was opened, leaving the 125 Volt DC Bus powered by the battery chargers. Computer history
shows the breaker was opened at 0757 and was closed at 1431 on January 4, 2023. During those six and a half hours,
PORV PCV-0655A would not have power to actuate the Solenoid Operated Valve (SOV) to open the PORV if there was a
loss of offsite power and either Standby Diesel Generator #11 or the 125 Volt DC Bus was not promptly restored. Because
the safety related design function of the PORVs is manual RCS pressure control with a loss of offsite power, from 0757
until 1431 on January 4, 2023, the PORVs could not have fulfilled their safety function for manual control of RCS pressure.
B. Plant Operating Conditions Prior To Event
Prior to the event on March 18, 2023, Unit 1 was In Mode 4 at 0% power.

NARRATIVE
03/18/23 (1400) - Recommenced surveillance test of PCV-0656A.
03/18/23 (1420) - PCV-0656A opened and closed successfully. Reactor Coolant System pressure changed from 365 psig
to 359 psig.
03/18/23 (1432) - PCV-0656A opened and closed successfully from the Aux Shutdown Panel during surveillance testing.
03/18/23 (1500) - Completed PORV operability test satisfactorily.
03/30/23 (1336) - Maintenance craft discovered an opening orifice installed in the solenoid operated valve for PCV-0656A
while performing a work order. This is the same solenoid operated valve assembly that was installed during 1RE23.
Therefore, the opening orifice was in place during the entire operating cycle 24 and when PCV-0656A was tested on
03/18/23.
E. Method of Discovery
The failure of the Unit 1 Pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valve to open was self-revealing as it was discovered during
surveillance testing.
II. Component Failures
A. Failure Mode, Mechanism, and Effects of Failed Component
The failed component in this event was the Unit 1 Pressurizer PORV (B1RCPCV0656A). The pressurizer PORV failed to
open when operated from the control room hand switch. The mechanism by which the PORV failed to open was
determined to be a combination of conditions including an installed orifice, clearance tolerance, and two-phase flow
conditions. The effect of the failed component is that the pressurizer PORV was declared inoperable as it would have
been unable to perform its safety function for manual control of RCS pressure from 11/03/2021 to 03/18/2023. This
resulted in two trains of a component or system to be inoperable between the times 0757 and 1431 on January 4, 2023,
which caused a loss of safety function to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
B. Cause of Component or System Failure
The cause of this event was determined to be the result of three conditions occurring simultaneously, which caused the
pressurizer PORV to fail to open. The first condition was an opening orifice was installed in the solenoid operated valve;
this slowed the opening of the pressurizer PORV by limiting the flow rate through the solenoid. The second condition was
the clearance tolerance between the valve plug and valve cage were low out of specification. That reduced the upward
force on the valve plug and there was flow past the plug ring between the valve plug and valve cage that exceeded the
flow rate through the opening orifice. The third condition was that the pressurizer PORV’s respective block valve was
closed in accordance with technical specification Action A, which would most likely result in a two-phase flow condition
that would result in water flashing to steam due to a pressure drop from tight clearances that would cause a choked flow
condition at the opening orifice.
C. Systems or Secondary Functions That Were Affected by the Failure of Components with Multiple Functions
No additional systems or secondary functions were affected by this failure.

Component: Valve, Solenoid Pressure {PSV}
Manufacturer: Crosby Valve Div/Geosource Inc {C710}
Model: DS-C-67970-13
III. Analysis of Event
A. Safety System Responses that Occurred
No safety system responses occurred because of this event.
B. Duration of Safety System Inoperability
The capability of the PORV to meet its design function for manual control of RCS Pressure if it had been called upon
to perform its safety functions during the time window from November 3, 2021, to March 18, 2023, is not assured.
C. Safety Consequences and Implications
The increase in risk due to the inoperability of PCV-0656A during the time period from November 3, 2021, to March 18,
2023, represents a very small change in risk. A maximum exposure time is limited to one year resulting in a delta-CDF
or ICDP of 1.69E-07 and delta-LERF or ILERP of 1.06E-09. These results represent very small changes in risk per
Regulatory Guide 1.174. For general transients, site-specific analysis demonstrates that bleed and feed success
criteria requires 1 pressurizer PORV, a centrifugal charging pump (CCP) and 1 train of high head safety injection
(HHSI) to mitigate the primary temperature and pressure increase for the bounding general transient case scenario of
a Total Loss of Main Feedwater Flow event.
This event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates and there were no
personnel injuries or damage to other safety-related equipment. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health
and safety of the public.
IV. Cause of Event
The causal evaluation for this event determined that there were two root causes.
The first root cause determined that the procedure for pressurizer PORV maintenance lacked the specific guidance to:
(1) verify that the opening orifice was not installed and (2) measure and validate the clearance between the valve plug
and valve cage to ensure the pressurizer PORV was assembled to the vendor manual specifications.
The second root cause determined there was inadequate implementation of the previous design change package
(97-2766-6) that allowed the purchase of a replacement SOV with an opening orifice for the pressurizer PORVs that
resulted in a loss of configuration management for an ASME Class 1 component when it was installed.

V. Corrective Actions
The corrective action to prevent reoccurrence is to revise the procedure for pressurizer PORV maintenance so that the
opening orifice is verified to have been removed, to specify an additional procedure to be included if the pressure
boundary has been breached for maintenance, and to add steps to take and document as left measurements for valve
parts and to verify tolerances with the vendor manual.
The additional corrective actions include:
1. STP Engineering to review the associated pressurizer PORV drawings and update accordingly.
2. Updating the Master Parts List databases and the Procurement Inventory Control System databases to be in
alignment with the design change package (CR 97-2766-6).
3. Develop lessons learned for Engineering of design products and their effects of configuration control.
4. Develop lessons learned for Maintenance and Work Planners to ensure procedure adequacy in relation to vendor
manuals.
5. Revise the STP procedure “Outage Preparation and Implementation Guideline” to evaluate the risk of operating a
complete fuel cycle with a safety related component inoperable, despite allowance by a Technical Specification.
6. Perform a needs analysis on outage training for operations on Technical Specifications 4.0.5 and 4.4.10 and their
application with Technical Specification 3.4.4 Action A during startup.
VI. Previous Similar Events
A previous similar event, PCV-0656A failed to open during surveillance testing, this was identified entering outage
1RE23 on October 9, 2021, at 0833. The failure was determined to be a result of mechanical rubbing between the
