On October 6, 2022 at 1300 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, ultrasonic
testing (UT) measurements on the “A” train residual heat removal (RHR) piping identified a gas void greater than acceptance
criteria. The most likely source of gas voids in this section of pipe was determined to be inadequate guidance in the operating
procedures used to perform filling and venting activities during system restorations following the refueling outage in May
2022. The entire length of piping was vented and UT measurements at multiple locations verified that the voids were reduced
to within acceptable limits. This condition is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition
prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423
052 2022 - 003 - 00
NARRATIVE
On October 6, 2022 at 1300 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power,
ultrasonic testing (UT) measurement on “A” train residual heat removal (RHR) piping identified a gas void greater than
the acceptance criteria. The UT measurement was taken during monthly performance of SP 3610A.3, “RHR System
Vent and Valve(cid:9) Lineup Verification” on the “A” low pressure safety injection to charging pump suction line,
3-SIL-008-14-2, at Point 10. The “A” train of RHR was declared inoperable and Technical Specifications (TS) 3.5.2,
Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) was entered. Venting was performed and the ECCS system was declared
operable in accordance with SP 3610A.3 on October 6, 2022 at 1725 hours and TS 3.5.2 was exited.
On October 14, 2022, SP3610A.3 was performed at point 10 and a gas void greater than acceptance criteria was
observed in the line 3-SIL-008-14-2. “A” train of RHR was declared inoperable, and TS 3.5.2 was entered on October 14,
2022, at 1005 hours. Point 10 was vented and a UT was performed and confirmed that the piping was 100% full of water.
TS 3.5.2 was exited on October 14, 2022, at 1737 hours.
Troubleshooting was performed on October 15, 2022 to fully characterize the gas void in line 3-SIL-008-14-2. To support
this troubleshooting, TS 3.5.2 was entered and “A” train of RHR was declared inoperable on October 15, 2022 at 0944
hours. This line was divided into 10 sections and full expanded ultrasonic testing measurements were taken at each
section. Repeated venting and agitation of the line was performed to remove the gas voids.
After the initial expanded UT characterization, it was concluded that the remaining gas void volume was greater than the
acceptable gas void volume. After repeated venting and agitation evolutions, the final UT characterization determined
that the gas void volume was less than acceptable limits. An operability determination evaluated the(cid:9) as-left condition
and determined that “A” train of RHR was able to perform its design function. The ECCS system was declared operable
and TS 3.5.2 was exited on October 17, 2022 at 1441 hours.
On August 31, 2023, an NRC inspector identified a non-conservative error within the void volume calculation
14-ENG-04518M3 “MP3 GL2008-01 Pump Suction Side Gas Void Allowable Volume Using Westinghouse Simplified
Equation Method” approved in 2015. Millstone engineering determined that the pressure used for evaluating a void
volume in line 3-SIL-008-014-2 was incorrect and non-conservative. This error resulted in the reduction of the allowable
void size acceptance criteria.
Based on the corrected acceptable void volume, the original as-found gas void volume identified on October 6, 2022,
was greater than the allowable acceptable gas void volume; therefore, the plant was operating in a condition outside of
plant Technical Specifications. Void volume greater than acceptable limits existed from May 18, 2022, when the plant
entered Mode 3, until October 17, 2022 when void volume was verified to be less than acceptable limits.
SP 3610A.3 is performed monthly and the line 3-SIL-008-014-2 was verified to be full of water each month from the
refueling outage until its performance on October 6, 2022. Prior to October 17, 2022, the procedure SP 3610A.3
directed that a single UT measurement to be taken at Point 10 on line 3-SIL-008-14-2 to measure the gas void volume.
This did not fully characterize the void volume in line 3-SIL-008-14-2. The procedure SP 3610A.3 has been revised to
include additional UT locations that fully characterize the void volume.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423

NARRATIVE
In Modes 1, 2, and 3, Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2 "ECCS Subsystems - Tavg Greater Than or Equal to 350°F,"
requires two independent ECCS subsystems be operable, with each subsystem comprised of a minimum of one charging
pump (CHS), one safety injection pump (SIH), one residual heat removal pump (RHR), one containment recirculation
pump (RSS), one RHR heat exchanger, and one RSS heat exchanger together with associated valves and piping to
assure adequate core cooling in the event of a design basis loss of coolant accident (LOCA). In Modes 1, 2, and 3,
Technical Specifications require that the ECCS be verified filled at least once every 31 days. The TS is met by venting
ECCS pump casings and the accessible discharge piping high points.
The previous historic operability assessment performed for the gas void found in line 3-SIL-008-014-2 from October 17,
2022, has been reviewed and determined that an incorrect determination of historic operability was made. The historic
gas void size has been determined to be unacceptable, and a Licensee Event Report (LER) should have been generated
due to discovery on October 6, 2022 and submitted by December 5, 2022.
Event Date: October 6, 2022 – Gas void first discovered in the “A” RHR piping. Gas void was found greater than
acceptance criteria per SP 3610A.3.
Discovery Date: August 31, 2023 – NRC inspector found non-conservative error in the calculation 14-ENG-041518M3
which resulted in the reduction of allowable void size acceptance criteria.
This report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), as an operation or condition that was prohibited by
the plant's Technical Specifications.
CAUSE
Most likely source of gas voids in this section of pipe was determined to be inadequate guidance in the operating
procedures used to perform filling and venting activities during system restorations.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
The gas void at Point 10 was located in the 8” common suction header between the RSS pump discharge and the CHS
pump suction. This section of piping only experiences flow during post Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) cold leg
recirculation. Thus, the gas void at this location could only affect CHS pumps during the cold leg recirculation phase of a
LOCA.
The core response of postulated Loss of Coolant Accidents is discussed in Section 15.6.5 of the Final Safety Analysis
Report (FSAR). The acceptance criteria for the response to a LOCA are described in Title 10 of the Code of Federal
Regulations 50.46 (10 CFR 50.46). Three of the acceptance criteria i.e., peak cladding temperature (PCT), maximum
local oxidation (MLO) and core-wide oxidation (CWO) are approached prior to cold leg recirculation during the ECCS
injection phase. Therefore, these criteria would be unaffected by the presence of a gas void in line 3-SIL-008-14-2.
The remaining 10 CFR 50.46 criteria addresses the core remaining amenable to cooling during, and after, the LOCA and
reduction in core temperature by decay heat removal for an extended period of time. These criteria are met by
demonstrating successful transition from the ECCS injection phase to the post LOCA cold leg recirculation phase.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423
052 2022 - 003 - 00
NARRATIVE
In the normal post LOCA cold leg recirculation configuration, the RSS pumps take suction from the containment sump to
provide suction to the SIH pumps and CHS pumps. The high head CHS pumps and the intermediate head SIH pumps
are aligned to provide injection into the reactor coolant system (RCS) cold legs.
Should the gas void interfere with the operation of a charging pump in establishing post LOCA cold leg recirculation,
EOP 35 ES-1.3, “Transfer to cold leg recirculation”, has instructions to open a RHR cold leg injection valve. Cold leg
recirculation flow would then be provided from the RSS pumps through the RHR injection lines as well as through the
SIH pumps. This would allow for successful cold leg recirculation to be established.
The containment response to a LOCA is discussed in FSAR Section 6.2.1. The peak containment temperature and
pressure also occur early in the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) injection phase of the accident. The post ESF
injection containment spray recirculation is not impacted by the point 10 void location.
Therefore, it is concluded that the plant response to a LOCA will be unchanged from the results as presented in the
FSAR.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The entire length of pipe was vented to remove gas voids. UT measurements were performed at multiple locations along
the piping to verify that voids were reduced to within acceptable limits. Operating procedures have been enhanced to
include instructions for filling and venting this line and assuring that ECCS piping is verified sufficiently full of water.
Additional corrective actions will be taken in accordance with the station’s corrective action program.
PREVIOUS OCCURANCES
There have been no similar events or conditions related to Unit 3 ECCS train inoperable for a period longer than the
technical specification action statement allows over the last 5 years.
