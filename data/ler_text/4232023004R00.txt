At 1428 hours on October 20, 2023, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 5 at 0 percent reactor power, it was identified
that three reactor(cid:9) coolant(cid:9) system(cid:9) pressure(cid:9) isolation(cid:9) valves(cid:9) (PIVs),(cid:9) had(cid:9) measured(cid:9) back-leakage(cid:9) greater(cid:9) than(cid:9) the
Technical Specification (TS) acceptance criteria. The likely cause of the excessive leak rate was age related degradation that
resulted in leakage past the check valve seats. The valves were successfully replaced and retested. It was determined that
this leakage existed during the past operating cycle for a period longer than permitted by the plant’s TS allowed outage time.
This condition is being reported(cid:9) pursuant to(cid:9) 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition prohibited by the
plant's Technical Specifications.

NARRATIVE
At 1428 hours on October 20, 2023, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 5 at 0 percent reactor power, it was
identified that three reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves (PIVs), 3RCS*V70, 3RCS*V106 and 3RCS*V145
had measured back-leakage greater than Technical Specification (TS) acceptance criteria per surveillance procedure
SP3601F.4, “Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Pressure Isolation Valve Test”.
RCS leakage is required by TS 3.4.6.2.2, “Reactor Coolant System, Operational Leakage” to be less than 0.5 gpm
leakage per nominal inch of valve size up to a maximum of 5 gpm at an RCS pressure of 2,230 to 2,270 psia. The
subject check valves are 1 1/2 inch RCS pressure isolation valves, 3RCS*V70, 3RCS*V106 and 3RCS*V145. The technical
specification acceptance criteria for each individual valve should be less than or equal to 0.75 gpm.
Surveillance procedure SP 3601F.4, “RCS Pressure Isolation Valve Test”, is performed every refueling outage prior to
Mode 4 as part of RCS Pressure Isolation Valve (PIV) leakage verification. These valves are tested together as
a group with the option to test individually, if needed.
Upon reviewing the performance of these check valves conducted in prior refueling outages per SP 3601F.4, the leak
testing results showed the combined leakage from 3RCS*V29, 3RCS*V70, 3RCS*V106 and 3RCS*V145 to be 0.74 gpm
versus a TS acceptance limit of 0.75 gpm. With little margin to the acceptance criteria the station prepared for a
possible replacement of one or all check valves.
On October 20, 2023, during a refueling outage, the test showed that the individual leakage from 3RCS*V070,
3RCS*V106 and 3RCS*V145 were each greater than the TS acceptance criteria.
The required TS 3.4.6.2.2 actions, while in Mode 1-4, are to isolate the high-pressure portion of the affected
system from the low-pressure portion within 4 hours by use of at least two closed manual or deactivated automatic
valves or be in at least hot standby within the next 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours.
Per NUREG 1022, “Event Report Guidelines”, the existence of similar discrepancies in multiple valves is an indication
that the discrepancies may well have arisen over a period of time and that the failure mode should be evaluated to
determine reportability. The leakage test common failure mode of all three check valves indicates that the discrepancy
occurred earlier, during the operating cycle, and that these PIVs were therefore inoperable for greater that the TS
allowed outage time of 4 hours. This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), as "any operation or
condition prohibited by the plant's technical specifications".
CAUSE
After removal of the three valves from the RCS, a borescope was used to perform an internal inspection. No obvious
signs of damage or wear that would have resulted in the excessive leakage observed from the associated RCS check
valves was found. The likely cause of the excessive leak rate was age related degradation that resulted in leakage
past the seat of 3RCS*V070, 3RCS*V106 and 3RCS*V145.

NARRATIVE
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
If a safety injection signal is present, the charging pumps (one pump assuming a single train failure, both pumps
assuming no failure) will be forward flowing in the safety injection (SIH) lines through 3SIH*MV8801A and/or
3SIH*MV8801B (depending upon failure assumption). Downstream of the MV8801’s, the SIH lines join into a single
section of piping before splitting into four individual lines, each line containing one of the injection check valves in
question.
This is true whether the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) is in the injection alignment with the refueling water
storage tank (RWST) as the source of water to the charging pumps or in the recirculation alignment with containment
sump fluid, boosted by the recirculation spray system (RSS) pumps for the source of water for the charging pumps.
The charging pumps provide the highest head injection flow of the ECCS pumps that respond to a safety injection (SI)
signal. Thus, there is no loss of coolant accident (LOCA) scenario in which the RCS pressure would be higher than the
forward flow in the SIH lines and hence result in back flow through the leaking check valves and reduction in ECCS flow
delivered to the RCS beyond that already assumed in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) Chapter 15 safety
analysis.
IIf a safety injection signal is not present, 3SIH*MV8801A/B which are normally closed motor operated valves (MOVs),
open only in response to a safety injection signal. Thus, barring an assumed break in the SIH piping between the
MV8801’s and the RCS, the check valves ‘leak’ into a closed system. Thus, no loss of reactor coolant would occur.
Assuming a break in the piping between the MV8801’s and the RCS, the noted rate of coolant loss is sufficiently small
that the charging pumps would be able to compensate for the loss in their normal chemical and volume control
system (CVCS) alignment.
Therefore, the as found leakage rates in 3RCS*V070, 3RCS*V106 and 3RCS*V145, will not challenge a safety function
credited in the Chapter 15 safety analysis.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
RCS check valves 3RCS*V70, 3RCS*V106 and 3RCS*V145 were successfully replaced and retested during the
refueling(cid:9) outage. Additional corrective actions will be taken in accordance with the station’s Corrective Action
Program.
PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES
There have been no similar events or conditions where RCS PIVs operational leakage was outside the technical
specification acceptance criteria over the last 5 years.
