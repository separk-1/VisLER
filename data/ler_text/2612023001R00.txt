On June 12, 2023, at 16:41 Eastern Daylight Time, with H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 in Mode 1 at
100% power, the nitrogen supply to the "A" Pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valve (PORV) was isolated due to a
nitrogen leak. By design, Instrument Air was available to the "A" PORV allowing it to perform its safety function.
After further review, it was determined that isolating the nitrogen supply to the "A" PORV resulted in inability to
meet Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.4.11.4 and Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO)
3.4.11 Condition A should have been entered for an inoperable PORV. The cause was improper application of the
TS. This event did not impact the health and safety of the public.

NARRATIVE
BACKGROUND
Prior to the event, H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 (RNP) was in Mode 1 at 100% power with no
structures, systems or components out of service that contributed to this event. The pressurizer [PZR] Power Operated
Relief Valves (PORV) and their respective block valves are provided for plant operational flexibility and for limiting the
number of challenges to the pressurizer safety valves. The normal source of motive power for PORVs is the plant nitrogen
system [LK]. An accumulator in series with each PORV provides multiple cycles of operation if the nitrogen supply is lost.
The alternate source of motive power is the instrument air system [LD]. If the nitrogen pressure to the valve operator falls
below a preset value, instrument air is automatically aligned to the valve.
The event described below is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B): "Any operation or condition which was prohibited by
the plant's Technical Specifications except when: (1) The Technical Specification is administrative in nature; (2) The event
consisted solely of a case of a late surveillance test where the oversight was corrected, the test was performed, and the
equipment was found to be capable of performing its specified safety functions; or (3) The Technical Specification was
revised prior to discovery of the event such that the operation or condition was no longer prohibited at the time of
discovery of the event." This criterion requires a Licensee Event Report be submitted within 60 days of the event date.
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On June 12, 2023, at 16:41 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), a containment vessel [NH] entry was performed to identify a
nitrogen leak in containment. The operator found the "A" Accumulator Low Pressure Safety Relief Valve [RV] lifting.
PCV-3, Train "A" Nitrogen Regulator [RG] (Victor Model SR700MD (1/2")), pressure indicated greater than 130 psig. The
normal setpoint for PCV-3 is 90-95 psig. An attempt to adjust the regulator to the correct pressure was unsuccessful. This
resulted in the decision to close OPP-25, Train "A" Isolation for nitrogen. Closure of OPP-25 resulted in isolation of the
nitrogen line and nitrogen accumulator from pressurizer PORV PCV-456. Instrument air backup was still available.
Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.11 was entered on June 14, 2023, at time 11:11 EDT to replace PCV-3. The
PORV was returned to service and the LCO exited on June 14, 2023 at time 11:52 EDT.
Upon further review, closure of OPP-25 isolated the nitrogen supply to the "A" PORV which resulted in the inability to meet
Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.4.11.4 to verify accumulators are capable of operating a PORV through one complete
cycle. Technical Specification (TS) LCO 3.4.11 Condition A should have been entered for an inoperable PORV. The
required actions are to close and maintain power to the associated PORV block valve within one hour or, as required by
TS LCO 3.4.11 Condition D, be in Mode 3 within six hours and Mode 4 in twelve hours. The failure to perform the TS
required actions within the required completion time resulted in a condition prohibited by the TS which is reportable in
accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).
CAUSAL FACTORS
An incorrect conclusion was reached by Duke Energy licensed operators on applicability of TS 3.4.11. Specifically, it was
not identified that isolating the nitrogen accumulator resulted in the inability to meet TS SR 3.4.11.4 to demonstrate the
accumulators are capable of supplying sufficient nitrogen to operate the PORVs.
A contributing factor to this event is that Operations Work Procedure OWP-016, Safety Injection System, includes a
Precaution that inaccurately states: "Isolating Nitrogen to the PORVs has no impact on Tech Spec operability of the
PORVs or plant risk profile provided the PORVs are supplied by Instrument Air as a backup motive force and the PORVs
can be cycled manually". This contributed to the operators' decision on applicability of TS 3.4.11.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Completed Actions:
1. PCV-3 was replaced, and nitrogen supply restored.
2. A Crew Learning was shared with Operations.
3. Missed Technical Specification entered into corrective action program
Planned Actions:
1. Evaluate a change to the TS and TS basis to ensure the operability requirements are clear and the SRs are correct to
test the system requirements.
2. Revise Precaution in OWP-016.
3. Provide training to Licensed Operators on the event to include a discussion on SR 3.0.1.
Any changes to the corrective actions or completion schedules will be made in accordance with the site's corrective action
program.
SAFETY ANALYSIS
This condition was assessed utilizing the zero test and maintenance probabilistic risk assessment model for RNP and was
determined to have a very low safety significance. This event resulted in no impact to the health and safety of the public.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
An operating experience (OE) search was conducted and no previous Licensee Event Reports were found at RNP
regarding any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications within the past five
years.
Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes for systems and components relevant to this event are identified in the
