On October 30, 2022, at 20:57 Eastern Daylight Time, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was in Mode 3 at 0%
power. An automatic actuation of the auxiliary feedwater (AFW) system occurred during an attempt to start the ‘B’ main
feedwater pump (MFP). Prior to the event, the ‘A’ MFP was removed from service due to its power supply, the ‘A’ electrical
auxiliary bus, being under clearance. The ‘B’ MFP switch was taken to start and the ‘B’ MFP breaker did not close, which
resulted in a valid AFW system actuation signal for loss of the last running MFP. The ‘A’ and ‘B’ motor-driven AFW (MDAFW)
pumps were in service for steam generator inventory control prior to the AFW system actuation and remained in service following
the event. The MDAFW flow control valves (FCVs) automatically opened as designed when the AFW actuation signal was
received. Operations took action to control the AFW flow rate by throttling the FCVs. This event is being reported in accordance
with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in an automatic actuation of the AFW system. The AFW system
responded to plant conditions as designed. The cause of the ‘B’ MFP failure to start was an open limit switch alignment
deficiency on the ‘B’ MFP recirculation line condenser isolation valve. Misalignment of the limit switch prevented meeting the
start permissive for the ‘B’ MFP. The limit switch on the ‘B’ MFP recirculation line condenser isolation valve was adjusted to
obtain proper alignment. Procedural guidance will be revised to require start permissive verification checks prior to starting a
MFP. This event did not impact public health and safety.

NARRATIVE
Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets [].
A. Background
Prior to the event, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was in Mode 3 at 0% power following an automatic
reactor [RCT] trip that occurred on October 30, 2022, at 06:53 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). Following the reactor trip and
prior to the event, the ‘A’ electrical auxiliary bus [BU], which is the power supply to the ‘A’ main feedwater pump (MFP) [SJ
P], was under clearance that required the ‘A’ MFP to be removed from service. The ‘A’ and ‘B’ motor-driven auxiliary
feedwater (MDAFW) pumps [BA Ps] were in service prior to the event. HNP remained in Mode 3 after the event.
This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as “Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic
actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)...[including] auxiliary or emergency feedwater (AFW)
system [BA]...”
The AFW system serves as a backup system for supplying feedwater to the secondary side of the steam generators [SG]
at times when the MFW system [SJ] is not available, thereby maintaining the heat sink capabilities of the steam
generators. The system provides an alternate to the MFW system during start-up, hot standby, and cooldown and also
functions as an engineered safety features actuation system [JE]. In the latter function, the AFW system is directly relied
upon to prevent core damage in the event of transients such as loss of main feedwater or a secondary system pipe
rupture.
B. Event Description
On October 30, 2022, at 20:57 EDT, HNP was in Mode 3 at 0% power. An automatic actuation of the AFW system
occurred during an attempt to start the ‘B’ MFP. Prior to the event, the ‘A’ MFP was removed from service due to its power
supply, the ‘A’ electrical auxiliary bus, being under clearance. The ‘B’ MFP switch was taken to start and the ‘B’ MFP
breaker did not close, which resulted in a valid AFW system actuation signal for loss of the last running MFP. The ‘A’ and
‘B’ MDAFW pumps were in service for steam generator inventory control prior to the AFW system actuation and remained
in service following the event. The MDAFW flow control valves (FCVs) [BA FCVs] automatically opened as designed when
the AFW actuation signal was received. Operations took action to control the AFW flow rate by throttling the FCVs.
C. Causal Factors
The cause of the ‘B’ MFP failure to start was an open limit switch [33] alignment deficiency on the ‘B’ MFP recirculation
line condenser [COND] isolation valve [ISV]. Misalignment of the limit switch prevented meeting the start permissive for
the ‘B’ MFP. Start permissive verification checks were not required to be completed in accordance with procedural
guidance prior to starting the ‘B’ MFP.
D. Corrective Actions
The deficient limit switch on the ‘B’ MFP recirculation line condenser isolation valve was adjusted to obtain proper
alignment. Procedural guidance will be revised to require start permissive verification checks prior to starting a MFP.
