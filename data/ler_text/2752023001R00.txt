At 20:14 Pacific Daylight Time on September 30,2023, with Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at
approximately 11 percent reactor power in preparation for a pre-planned manual reactor trip into a scheduled refueling
outage, the reactor was manually tripped due to increasing water level in Feedwater Heater (FWH) 1-5A caused by a
secondary system dump valve which remained in the closed position. Auxiliary feedwater was manually started in
accordance with plant procedures.
This event is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).
The cause of the increased feedwater level was due to Level Control Valve LCV-9 remaining in the closed position.
The valve has been repaired and corrective actions will be managed in accordance with the DCPP Corrective Action
Program.
There was no plant or public safety impact.

NARRATIVE
I.R eporting Requirements
This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) and the associated guidance of
NUREG-1022, Revision 3, due to a manual reactor trip and the subsequent manual actuation of the auxiliary
feedwater (AFW) system in accordance with plant procedures.
This event was initially reported in Event Notification 56769 in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR
50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A).
II.P lant Conditions
At the time of the event, Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately
11 percent power in preparation for pre-planned manual reactor trip for entry into a scheduled refueling
outage.
III.P roblem Description
A. Background
The condensate system and main feedwater system (MFWS) are non-safety-related systems whose function
is to supply preheated feedwater to the steam generators (SGs). These systems improve overall plant
efficiency by regeneratively heating feedwater as it is pumped through low and high-pressure feedwater
heaters (FWHs) prior to the entering the SGs. The condensate and MFWS are not required to ensure safe
shutdown of the nuclear steam supply system.
B. Event Description
At 20:14 Pacific Daylight Time on September 30,2023, with DCPP Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approximately
11 percent reactor power in preparation for a pre-planned manual reactor trip into a scheduled refueling
outage, the reactor was manually tripped due to increasing water level in FWH 1-5A. Following the trip, AFW
was manually started in accordance with station procedures. The cause of the increasing water level in the
FWH was determined to be due to dump valve LCV-9 remaining in the closed position. The valve was
subsequently repaired and associated corrective actions will be managed in accordance with the DCPP
Corrective Action Program.
C. Status of Inoperable Structures, Systems, or Components that Contributed to the Event
There were no inoperable Technical Specification structures, systems, or components that contributed to the
event.

NARRATIVE
D.M ethod of Discovery
Increased water level in FWH 1-5A was validated by Operations personnel following the receipt of the
associated control room annunciator.
E. Operator Actions
The Operations crews responded to this event in accordance with plant operating procedures.
F.S afety System Responses
Plant systems responded as expected following the manual reactor trip.
IV.C ause of the Problem
The cause of the water level increase in FWH 1-5A was a result of dump valve LCV-9 remaining in the closed
position.
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
There was no plant or public safety impact.
VI. Corrective Actions
Dump valve LCV-9 was repaired. Additional follow-up corrective actions will be managed in accordance with
the DCPP Corrective Action Program.
VII. Additional Information
None.
