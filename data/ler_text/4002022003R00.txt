On April 29, 2022, at 04:05 Eastern Daylight Time, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), in Mode 1 at 100
percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to degrading condenser vacuum approaching the turbine trip setpoint. The
trip was not complex, with all systems responding normally post-trip. The Reactor Protection System and Auxiliary Feedwater
System actuated as designed. A monthly swap of the Main Condenser Air Removal System vacuum pumps (CVPs) was in
progress at the time of this event. When the 'B' CVP was secured, the suction isolation valve, 1AE-16, and the 'B' CVP discharge
check valve, 1AE-19, failed to close, resulting in a rapid decrease in condenser vacuum. The rate of vacuum degradation did not
allow time for manual isolation prior to the manual reactor trip. The root cause of this event is the combination of two
simultaneous equipment failures, resulting in a large volume of main condenser air-in-leakage. The 1AE-16 failure cause is
indeterminate; however, the likely cause is an intermittent malfunction of the control relay associated with the solenoid operated
valve (SOV) that controls 1AE-16 actuator operation. The 1AE-19 failure cause is attributed to poor valve construction with the
disk arm not being centered, resulting in contact between the disc and valve body. Corrosion product buildup along this contact
surface caused valve binding. The CVP operating procedure was revised to close the CVP manual suction isolation valve prior to
securing the CVP. Control relays and a circuit breaker mechanism operated cell assembly for 1AE-16 were replaced. 1AE-19
was replaced. The 1AE-16 SOV and the ‘A’ CVP discharge check valve will be replaced.

NARRATIVE
Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets [].
A. Background
Prior to the event, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100
percent power. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the time of this event that
contributed to the event. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as “Any event or condition that resulted in
manual actuation or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of [10 CFR 50.73]...” due to
actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JC] and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) [BA]. All actuated safety
systems functioned as designed.
The Main Condenser Air Removal System [SH] vacuum pumps (CVPs) [P] are designed to establish and maintain
condenser vacuum and to remove non-condensable gases during plant operation. Condenser vacuum is normally
maintained at approximately 2 to 4 inches of mercury (Hg) absolute to minimize condenser back pressure. Operating with
high back pressure may cause overheating of the turbine [TRB] elements, which could lead to distortion of the rotor and/or
turbine blading.
There are two 100 percent capacity two-stage liquid ring type CVPs that require seal water to function. The seal water
provides inlet spray at the inlet of the pump first stage which condenses vapors before they enter the main pump body.
Airflow passes from the compression stages into the moisture separator [SEP] tank [TK]. The moisture separator tank
allows the air to separate from the water in the discharge of the CVPs. Air is discharged to the Turbine Building vent stack.
The water remains in the moisture separator tank and serves as a reservoir for the seal water supply.
Each CVP has an air-operated suction valve [ISV] that isolates the CVPs from the condenser. Each of the suction valves
will open with the start of the associated CVP and will close when the CVP is secured. There is a check valve [V] on the
outlet of each moisture separator tank that prevents reverse flow when the CVP is shut down. This check valve provides a
backup to the CVP suction valve to prevent reverse flow through the moisture separator tank and CVP.
The air-operated suction valve is an air-to-open, spring-to-close butterfly valve with a piston actuator. The air supplied to
the valve actuator is controlled by a solenoid-operated valve (SOV) [SOL]. When the CVP is in operation, the SOV is
energized and supplying air to the actuator that opens the valve to provide a path to the condenser for drawing a vacuum.
When the CVP is off, the SOV is de-energized, which vents the air from the actuator, allowing the actuator spring to close
the valve.
B. Event Description
On April 29, 2022, at 04:05 Eastern Daylight Time, the reactor was manually tripped due to degrading condenser vacuum
approaching the turbine trip setpoint. The trip was not complex, with all systems responding normally post-trip. The RPS
and AFWS actuated as designed. A monthly swap of the CVPs was in progress at the time of this event. Prior to the pump
swap, the ‘B’ CVP was in operation with condenser pressure in the normal range of 3-4 inches Hg absolute and stable.
To begin the CVP swap sequence, the ‘A’ CVP was started at 03:59. Condenser pressure remained normal and stable
following the pump start. Approximately 2 minutes later, at 04:01, the ‘B’ CVP was secured and CVP effluent flow began to
increase within 5 seconds. When the ‘B’ CVP was secured, the operator noted that the ‘B’ CVP suction isolation valve,
1AE-16, did not close as expected. The operator then proceeded to close 1AE-53, ‘B’ CVP discharge isolation valve when
the manual reactor trip occurred.

NARRATIVE
Within 25 seconds of securing the ‘B’ CVP, the CVP effluent flow rate had exceeded the flow rate indicator range of 100
standard cubic feet per minute. Within 35 seconds of securing the ‘B’ CVP, condenser shell pressures begin to increase at
a rate of approximately 2.6 inches Hg per minute. Then, less than a minute later, the ‘B’ CVP’s separator tank low-low
level alarm was received. The large increase in effluent flow combined with 1AE-16 failing to shut and this low-low level
alarm indicate that the ‘A’ CVP was pulling water out of the ‘B’ CVP separator tank along with air through the ‘B’ CVP due
to the ‘B’ CVP discharge check valve, 1AE-19, not being closed.
After the CVP separator tank low-low level alarm was received, with condenser pressure continuing to increase,
operations personnel attempted to start the ‘B’ CVP. ‘B’ CVP failed to start and the alarm for B CVP trip was received. At
04:03, two minutes after the ‘B’ CVP was secured, the low condenser vacuum alarm was received that has a set point of
6.5 inches Hg absolute. Condenser pressures continued to increase and reached 8.5 inches Hg absolute, which is the
pre-established limit to result in a manual reactor trip in accordance with procedural guidance. At 04:04, the reactor trip
was manually initiated by operations personnel.
C. Causal Factors
The root cause of this event is the combination of two simultaneous equipment failures, resulting in a large volume of main
condenser air-in-leakage. When the 'B' CVP was secured, the suction isolation valve, 1AE-16, and the 'B' CVP discharge
check valve, 1AE-19, failed to close, resulting in a rapid decrease in condenser vacuum and a manual reactor trip. The
1AE-16 failure cause is indeterminate; however, the likely cause is an intermittent malfunction of the control relay [RLY]
associated with the SOV that controls 1AE-16 actuator operation. The 1AE-19 failure cause is attributed to poor valve
construction with the disk arm not being centered, resulting in contact between the disc and valve body. Corrosion product
buildup along this contact surface caused valve binding. Over-reliance by plant personnel on risk mitigation actions
instead of an elimination strategy during evolutions was also identified as a cause associated with this event.
D. Corrective Actions
The procedure used for CVP operation was revised to close the CVP manual suction isolation valve prior to securing the
CVP being removed from service. Control relays and a circuit breaker [72] mechanism operated cell assembly for 1AE-16
were replaced; forensic analysis on these removed components will be completed to identify any additional actions
needed to improve reliability. 1AE-19 was replaced. The 1AE-16 SOV will be replaced; forensic analysis on the removed
component will be completed to identify any additional actions needed to improve reliability. The ‘A’ CVP discharge check
valve will be replaced. Personnel will identify any normal operating procedural guidance that contains steps with the words
“immediately” or “immediate” and will revise applicable procedural guidance to incorporate acceptable completion times.
E. Safety Analysis
The manual reactor trip had no impact on public health and safety. The failure of the condenser vacuum system valves
that resulted in degraded condenser vacuum and led to the manual trip did not affect the post-trip response of the
feedwater and condensate systems. There was no loss in function of safety systems, structures, or components. There
were no significant equipment abnormalities. The condition did not result in a safety system functional failure and had no
adverse impact on the health and safety of the public.
F. Additional Information
There have been no events at HNP similar to the event documented in this LER in the past three years.
