On November 10, 2022, at 0744 hours, the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 2 Reactor automatically tripped from 44 percent
power, due to reaching the automatic trip setpoint for a high-high level in the #3 Steam Generator (SG).
Following the trip, Unit 2 was supplied by offsite power. All control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps started
and operated properly, and decay heat removal was through the Steam Dump System. All required equipment operated as
expected, and the trip was not complicated.
The high-high level in the #3 SG was caused by unrecoverable feedwater oscillations that occurred during power ascension.
A preliminary root cause of the oscillations was the organization's failure to recognize the effects of digital positioner tuning
on feedwater system stability. A root cause evaluation is ongoing at the time of the submittal of this Licensee Event Report
(LER). A supplement will be submitted if the causes or corrective actions are significantly different than described in this LER.
The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid actuation of the
Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the automatic reactor trip.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On November 10, 2022, at 0744 hours, the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant (CNP) Unit 2 Reactor automatically
tripped from 44 percent power, due to reaching a high-high level automatic trip setpoint in 2-OME-3-3, "Number 3
Steam Generator" (#3 SG) [SB][SG].
Following the reactor trip, Unit 2 was supplied by offsite power. All control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary
Feedwater Pumps [BA][P] started as required and operated properly. Decay heat removal was through the
Condenser Steam Dump System [JI][COND]. All required equipment operated as expected, and the trip was not
complicated.
Prior to the event, CNP had completed a scheduled refueling outage by synchronizing the generator [EL][GEN] to
the electrical grid on November 9, 2022, at 0011 hours.
On November 10, 2022, at 0515 hours, operators commenced power ascension at 1.6 Megawatts per hour, starting
from 26% power. At 0522 hours, feedwater system oscillations were observed on SG water level indications
[JB][L1] and operators performed actions to place 2-PP-1E, East Main Feed Pump [SJ][P] in manual Differential
Pressure (DP) control and raise pump speed.
In response to abnormal SG level indications becoming synchronized, operators began to stabilize power at 44%.
The East Main Feed Pump was placed in speed control and pump speed was raised from 4300 RPM to 4500
RPM. Operators attempted to control SG level by adjusting feedwater regulating valve controllers [JB][FCO]. SG
level rapidly increased and actions performed were unable to prevent level from rising to the reactor trip setpoint
of 67% in the #3 SG, and automatically tripping the reactor.
Investigation following the trip determined that the feedwater oscillations that occurred during power ascension
was due in part to the method used by operators to operate the Main Feed Pump with respect to the digital controls
and feedwater system configuration. Configuration of the system is based on 100% power output and two main
feed pumps in operation. Validation was obtained by providing pertinent input data to the site simulator team to
evaluate the scenario. The simulator results demonstrated that operating one Main Feed Pump in manual DP
mode at lower than program DP resulted in unrecoverable feedwater oscillations and SG levels.
Event Notification No. 56216 was submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), Reactor Protection System
(RPS) [JG] actuation as a four (4) hour non-emergency report, and under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), specified
system actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA], as an eight (8) hour non-emergency report.
The event is also reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid
actuation of the RPS and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the automatic reactor trip.

NARRATIVE
COMPONENT
There were no component failures that contributed to the event.
CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The high-high level in the #3 SG was caused by unrecoverable feedwater oscillations that occurred during power
ascension. A preliminary root cause of the oscillations was the organization's failure to recognize the effects of
digital positioner tuning on Unit 2 feedwater regulating valves which resulted in system instabilities. A root cause
evaluation is ongoing at the time of the submittal of this Licensee Event Report (LER). A supplement will be
submitted if the causes or corrective actions are significantly different than described in this LER.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
NUCLEAR SAFETY
All equipment operated as designed, and there was no actual or potential nuclear safety hazards that resulted
from the automatic reactor trip due to reaching the automatic trip setpoint for a high-high level in the #3 SG.
INDUSTRIAL SAFETY
There was no actual personnel safety hazard that resulted from the automatic reactor trip due to reaching the
automatic trip setpoint for a high-high level in the #3 SG.
RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY
There was no actual or potential radiological safety hazard or radiological release that resulted from the automatic
reactor trip due to reaching the automatic trip setpoint for a high-high level in the #3 SG.
PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT (PRA)
The safety significance of the Unit 2 trip during power ascension can be estimated by calculating the Conditional
Core Damage Probability (CCDP) and Conditional Large Early Release Probability (CLERP) of the transient
initiating event. A PRA risk assessment was performed and determined the estimated CCDP and the estimated
CLERP of this event. A comparison of the CCDP and CLERP estimates to regulatory guidance resulted in the
conclusion that this event was of very low safety significance.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
COMPLETED ACTIONS
Engineering direction was provided to operate the Unit 2 Main Feed Pumps in speed control and raise the pump
speed to achieve a higher DP during power ascension. The current operating procedure used allows for both DP
and speed control to operate the main feed pump. Therefore, a procedure change was not required to support
the recommendation.
PLANNED ACTIONS
Adjust digital tuning of the feedwater regulating valve positioners to improve feedwater system stability.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
A review of LERs for the past five years involving reactor trips was performed. None of the trips occurred from
similar causes.
