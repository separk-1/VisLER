At 1803 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on July 18, 2022, Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) experienced an automatic
reactor trip due to low level in the 'B' steam generator. WCGS was operating in MODE 1 at 100% power when the trip occurred.
ENS notification #56005 was made at 2017 CDT in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram, and 10
CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for an auxiliary feedwater system actuation. All control rods dropped, all equipment functioned as
designed, and offsite power remained available.
The direct cause of the event was a failure of the valve stem for the 'B' steam generator (SG) main feedwater regulating valve
(MFRV), causing the valve to fail closed and resulting in a loss of feedwater flow control to the 'B' SG. The hardware failure
analysis performed on the valve stem determined that the failure of the valve stem was due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC)
initiating from the external surface within the region contained within the packing area. The root cause investigation found that
during the previous valve rebuild, an inappropriate chemical (anti-seize) was applied to the stem for lubrication to assist in the
rebuild. It was the presence of this chemical which caused the SSC that led to the failure. All four MFRVs are scheduled to be
rebuilt during the upcoming refueling outage in October 2022 with all four valve stems then being sent off to be examined to look
for evidence of SCC.

NARRATIVE
PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENTS
The plant was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power when the reactor tripped. No systems, structures, or components
(SSCs) were inoperable at the beginning of the event which contributed to the event.
DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S)
Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes and component codes are identified in the text as [XX].
The main feedwater regulating valves (MFRVs) [SJ-FCV] are air operated angle valves which automatically control
feedwater flow to the steam generators (SGs) [SB-SG] between 30 percent and full power. The MFRVs are located in the
turbine building. The MFRVs also can provide backup isolation of main feedwater flow in the event that a main feedwater
isolation valve (MFIV) [SJ-ISV] fails to close.
Closure of the MFIVs or MFRVs terminates flow to the SGs, in the event of a feedwater line break occurring upstream of
the MFIVs or MFRVs. Since the MFIVs are located upstream of the point where the auxiliary feedwater lines connect to
the main feedwater lines, which is in turn upstream of the main feedwater check valves (located in Area 5 inside the
auxiliary building), closure of the MFIVs or the MFRVs ensures delivery of auxiliary feedwater to the SGs for support of the
auxiliary feedwater function in the event of a main feedwater line break in the turbine building.
AEFCV0520 is the MFRV on the main feedwater line which feeds the 'B' SG and has a Copes-Vulcan actuator. The
actuator valve stem is made from ASTM A276 Type 316 Condition B stainless steel with chrome plating.
EVENT DESCRIPTION
Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power on July 18, 2022, when at 18:02:55
Central Daylight Time (CDT), ‘B’ SG feed flow dropped from 3.85M lbm/hr to 690K lbm/hr. This caused an alarm in the
Control Room for ‘B’ SG Flow Mismatch. The Ovation feedwater control system responded by taking the ‘B’ MFRV
demand and positioning to 100% open as well as increasing main feedwater pump speed, though flow through the ‘B’ SG
did not respond. The Control Room Operators identified the issue and were in progress of tripping the reactor based on
these conditions; however, at 18:03:22 (27 seconds after first alarm), the reactor tripped automatically due to Low Level
on the ‘B’ SG (23.5% on 2/4 level instruments). This resulted in a Main Feedwater Isolation and an Auxiliary Feedwater
Actuation. All control rods dropped, all required safety systems functioned as designed, and offsite power remained
available.
BASIS FOR REPORTABILITY
The reactor trip and actuation of Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) instrumentation actuation
described in this event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), which requires reporting of "Any event or condition that
resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a) (2) (iv) (B) of this section..."
Paragraph (B)(1) of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) includes "Reactor Protection System (RPS) including: reactor scram or reactor
trip." Paragraph (B)(6) of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) includes "PWR auxiliary or emergency feedwater."
ENS notification 56005 was made at 2017 CDT on July 18, 2022, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), which
requires notification within 4 hours, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) which requires notification within 8 hours.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE
The direct cause of the event was a failure of the valve stem for the 'B' SG MFRV, causing the valve to fail closed and
resulting in a loss of feedwater flow control to the 'B' SG. The hardware failure analysis performed on the valve stem
determined that the failure of the valve stem was due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) initiating from the external
surface within the region contained within the packing area.
The root cause was determined to be that the work instructions for assembling MFRVs were inappropriately updated
to include a chemical (anti-seize) that was used in a way that is different than its intended purpose and was introduced
into the packing area, causing SCC in the stem until it ultimately failed.
A contributing cause was that the use of a chrome plated stem, rather than a stem with a polished stainless steel surface,
cultivated an environment for SCC to occur below the chrome layer. The unavoidable microcracks that are formed during
chrome plating allowed contaminants to deposit and promoted crack growth.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Actions taken:
-The 'B' MFRV was rebuilt and placed back into service with WCGS returning to Mode 1 at 0238 CDT on July 22, 2022.
-A training request was initiated for planners and implementers on the effects of chemicals on stainless steel components
and the importance of internal cleanliness.
-A training request was initiated for Engineers to better understand SCC, including External SCC and Outside Diameter
SCC.
Actions planned:
-Core Work Instructions (CWI) will be generated for MFRV disassembly and reassembly to ensure that the use of anti-
seize is not used as a lubricant on the unthreaded portion of the valve stem.
-The Vendor Technical Manual will be revised to include a note during the assembly of the valve to not use a lubricant on
the stem when lowering the bonnet onto the valve body.
-Preventive maintenance work orders for MFRV rebuilds will be revised to no longer include the use of anti-seize on the
stem during valve reassembly.
-The stems for all four MFRVs, which will be rebuilt during Refueling Outage 25 in October 2022, will be sent out to be
examined for evidence of SCC.
-Additionally, the design drawing for the MFRV will be revised to no longer allow the use of chrome plated valve stems.

NARRATIVE
SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE
There were no safety consequences impacting plant or public safety from this event. All control rods dropped, offsite
power remained available, and all safety equipment operated appropriately and as designed. There was no loss of any
function that would have prevented fulfillment of actions necessary to: shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a safe
shutdown condition, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an
accident.
OPERATING EXPERIENCE/PREVIOUS EVENTS
On August 18, 2021, WCGS experienced an automatic reactor trip due to Low Level in the 'B' SG (see LER 2021-004-00
dated October 18, 2021). The direct cause of this event was the propagation of a fatigue crack through the valve stem of
the 'B' MFRV which caused the stem to fracture resulting in a loss of feed flow control to the 'B' SG. The root cause was
determined to be tool marks within the thread root caused local stress risers, which allowed multiple cracks to initiate.
In addition, the thread root was also cut deeper and narrower than allowed by specification. This created an additional
stress riser which allowed the cracks to propagate into the body of the valve stem.(cid:9) Though, both failures occurred on the
same valve, this condition is not viewed as a repeat event due to differences in the failures. The valve stem that failed in
2021, had ultimately failed after 10 years of operation. The failure in 2022 occurred in the packing area and failed only
after 11 months of operation. The hardware failure analysis identified the cause of the failure in 2022 as SCC. There were
no signs of SCC in the failure area of the stem in 2021. Therefore, the failure of the stem in 2022 could not have been
prevented on what was known during the evaluation of the 2021 failure. Thus, this is not a repeat event.
