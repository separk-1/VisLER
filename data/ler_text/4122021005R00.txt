At 1313 on November 17, 2021, the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) reactor was manually tripped while at
approximately 100 percent power following a trip of a main feedwater pump (MFP) caused by a loss of adequate suction
pressure. A transient in the Heater Drain System occurred from a level increase in a Second Point Heater Drain Receiver Tank.
The level fluctuation resulted in an unexpected actuation of the tank's low-low level switch, which tripped the Train A Heater
Drain and Separator Drain Receiver Drain Pumps. The trip of these pumps reduced flow and lowered MFP suction pressure. The
standby condensate pump was not available to automatically start on low MFP pressure. When the MFP tripped, operators
manually tripped the reactor per procedure. With the spare condensate pump unavailable, MFP suction pressure was unable to
be restored and the manual reactor trip was procedurally required.
This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor
Protection System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1), and an automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System,
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6). Corrective actions include changes to procedural controls for conditional single point vulnerabilities
and condensate pump alignments above 40% power.

NARRATIVE
Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX].
BACKGROUND
The heater drain pumps and separator drain receiver drain pumps along with the condensate pumps provide flow at
sufficient pressure to the suction of the Main Feedwater Pumps (MFPs). BVPS-2 requires two condensate pumps in
service at full power to provide adequate MFP suction pressure. A third standby condensate pump provides redundancy
for any MFP suction flow transients that could challenge MFP operation and is normally aligned to auto-start on low MFP
suction pressure.
DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
At 1313 on November 17, 2021 while at approximately 100 percent power, the BVPS-2 reactor was manually tripped
following a trip of the 21B MFP [SJ] due to a loss of suction pressure. A transient in the Heater Drain System [SN]
commenced at 1300 due to a level increase in the 21A Second Point Heater Drain Receiver Tank. The level fluctuation
resulted in high tank level alarms in the control room at 1310, and due to the system perturbations an unexpected
actuation of the tank's low-low level switch occurred at 1312, which by design tripped the 21A Heater Drain Pump and the
22A Separator Drain Receiver Drain Pump. The trip of these two pumps reduced flow and lowered MFP suction pressure.
The standby third condensate pump [SD] was out of service for maintenance since prior to startup from refueling outage
2R22 on November 12, 2021, and was not available to automatically start on low MFP pressure. When the 21B MFP
tripped on low suction pressure at 1313, Control Room operators recognized the loss of a running MFP outside of
procedural requirements and manually tripped the reactor.
The trip was not complicated and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3. All control rods [AA] fully inserted into the reactor
core. The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) [BA] automatically actuated on low steam generator [SJ] water level as
expected, and the AFW system performed as designed. There was no safety-related equipment inoperable at the start of
the event that contributed to the event. The standby third condensate pump was unavailable at the start of the event and
this did contribute to the event.
CAUSE OF EVENT
The direct cause of the need to perform the manual reactor trip was the loss of MFP suction pressure resulting in an
automatic trip of a running MFP.
The apparent cause of this event is additional mitigating actions were not taken when the third condensate pump motor
was not returned from the vendor as scheduled. Had the standby third condensate pump been available, it would have
auto-started on low MFP suction pressure, preventing the trip of the running MFP, thus a manual reactor trip would not
have been necessary. Not having the standby condensate pump available created a conditional single point vulnerability
within the Condensate [SD] and Heater Drains systems that were not identified or mitigated.

NARRATIVE
ANALYSIS OF EVENT
The event was reported per Event Notification 55586 as an event that resulted in the actuation of the reactor protection
system, 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), and a specific system actuation, 10 CFR 50.72(B)(3)(iv)(A). This event is reportable
pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System,
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1), and the automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System,
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6).
The plant risk associated with the BVPS-2 reactor trip on November 17, 2021, is considered to be very low. This is based
on the change in average core damage frequency derived using the conditional core damage probability and change in
average large early release frequency derived using conditional large early release probability for the event. Therefore,
this event had very low safety significance.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Completed Actions:
1) The standby third condensate pump was returned to service on November 20, 2021.
Planned Actions:
1) Revise the risk management procedure to require additional risk management actions and to reassess conditional
single point vulnerabilities that remain out of service when exiting an outage.
2) Revise the maintenance notification screening procedure to incorporate conditional single point vulnerability screening
guidance.
3) Verify that planned maintenance strategies for the Unit 2 condensate pumps minimize out of service time when greater
than 40 percent power.
4) Revise the startup procedure that if the standby condensate pump is not available, enter an evaluation process prior to
power ascension above 40 percent power.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
A review of the previous three years identified that no similar events have occurred at BVPS.
