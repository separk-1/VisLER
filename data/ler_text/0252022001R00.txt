16. Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces. i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On October 6, 2022, at 0244 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 defueled at 0 percent power, the
Reactor Protection System automatically actuated during restoration of Division B Class 1E DC and Uninterruptible Power
Supply system. The cause of the actuation was due to inadequate procedural guidance. During restoration of VEGP Unit 3
Division B 72 hour DC bus, the breaker for the Unit 3 Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel was opened while performing a
lineup to establish initial conditions in accordance with the associated System Operating Procedure (SOP). This resulted in a
loss of power to Division B powered safety related air-operated valves, causing the valves to reposition to their fail-safe, loss-of-
power safety position. Due to 3-PXS-V108B (Passive Residual Heat Removal Heat Exchanger Outlet Flow Control Valve) failing
open a Reactor Trip signal was generated. The operators responded with approved procedures and restored power to the
Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel. As corrective action to address the cause of the event, procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001
was revised to improve separation of the 24 hour and 72 hour battery system alignments. This event is reportable under 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System, which is one of the systems listed in 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). VEGP Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 4 were unaffected during this event.

NARRATIVE (cid:9)
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On October 6, 2022. at 0244 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 defueled at 0 percent power. an
actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EIIS: JD] occurred during restoration of the Division B 72 hour DC bus
[EIIS EJ / BU] in the Class 1E DC and Uninterruptible Power Supply System [EIIS. EJ]. During restoration. the breaker
[EIIS: EJ / 72] for the Unit 3 Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel (3-IDSB-DD-1) was opened by the system operator
(non licensed). This resulted in a loss of power to Division B powered safety related air-operated valves. causing the
valves to reposition to their fail-safe, loss-of-power safety position. The reason for the RPS actuation was due to the
opening of the Division B Passive Residual Heat Removal (PRHR) Heat Exchanger Outlet Flow Control Valve (3-PXS-
V108B) [EIIS BP / FCV]. The reactor trip breakers were in an open state at the time of the event when the RPS signal
was received. therefore. the reactor trip breakers did not change state. The operators responded with approved
procedures and restored power to the Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel.
EVENT ANALYSIS
All systems operated as expected even though the Unit was not in operation. The cause of this event was inadequate
procedural guidance. Specifically. procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001. "Class 1E DC System-Division B.- included instructions
within the same attachment for both the 24 hour and 72 hour battery subsystems and resulted in operation of an
unintended component.
REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT
There were no safety consequences due to this event because the RPS signal was generated while the reactor was in a
defueled condition and did not impact plant safety. Additionally. no radiological release occurred due to this event. This
event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the RPS: which is one of the
systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B).
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED
Procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001 was revised to improve the separation of steps associated with the 24 hour battery system
and the 72 hour battery system alignments by separating them into different attachments in the procedure.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
There were no events from the last three years with either the same or similar cause to this event.
