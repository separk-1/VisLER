On 4/15/2021 FPL identified that Reactor Protection System (RPS) Technical Specification Functional Unit (FU) 20 had not met
Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements (TSSRs) during 5 discrete periods over the past 3 years. Due to RPS design
limitations, FU20, Automatic Trip and Interlock Logic, could not be fully tested above the P8 interlock (45% reactor power). The
trip functions not tested are automatically bypassed and not testable above the P8 interlock, but below P8 are active and TSSR
4.3.1.1 is applicable. During the identified periods the completion time was not met. Since the condition was unrecognized,
action was not taken, resulting in discrete periods of non-compliance with the TSAS.
The subject Actuation Logic Tests have since been completed and test frequencies adjusted in the Surveillance Frequency
Control Program to accommodate the RPS system design. All FU20 trip functions are operable and within approved surveillance
frequencies.
This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On 4/15/2021 FPL determined that RPS FU20, Automatic Trip and Interlock Logic, had not met TSSR 4.3.1.1. The
Actuation Logic Tests (ALT) that apply to several trip functions, due to the design of the RPS [JC], were not being
performed at the frequencies specified by the SFCP. The FU20 TSSRs include the ALTs as described in TS 4.3.3.1 Table
4.3-1, the 92-day (quarterly) frequencies for which are assigned by the SFCP. The affected FU20 trip functions tested by
the ALTs and their respective power interlocks include:
- Power Range Neutron Flux (low setpoint); <P10 (10% power)
- Intermediate Range Neutron Flux; <P10
- Source Range Neutron Flux; <P6 (10E-5 cps)
- Reactor Coolant Low Flow (2/3 loops); <P8 (45% power)
- Reactor Coolant Pump Breaker Open (2/3 loops); <P8
The SFCP previously prescribed a quarterly frequency to the ALT for each of these trip functions. However, the design of
the RPS is such that reactor power must be below the associated interlock of each trip function to perform the ALT. The
subject ALTs are active below the P8 interlock (45% reactor power). When the reactors are operating at full power these
trip functions are bypassed and the ALTs cannot be performed. If the ALT surveillance is past due and reactor power is
maneuvered to a level below the corresponding interlock, such as for equipment maintenance or a scheduled outage, the
TSSR is not met, rendering the FU20 channel inoperable. TS 3.3.1 Table 3.3-1 Action 8 directs shutdown to Mode 3 within
6 hours if a single channel is inoperable. In cases where both channels are inoperable TS 3.0.3 applies, also directing
shutdown to Mode 3 within 6 hours. Since the condition was unrecognized, action pursuant to the TSAS was not taken,
resulting in 5 discrete periods of TSAS non-compliance that occurred over the Past Operability Review (POR) assessment
period.
All of the periods of TS non-compliance during the assessment range occurred during power reductions of Units 3 and 4
for equipment maintenance or scheduled outages. Since there were no load reductions that went below 10% power and
scheduled outages begin with a manual reactor trip from approximately 15% power, only the trip functions associated with
the P8 (45%) interlock were non-compliant. This includes the Reactor Coolant Low Flow (2/3 loops) and RCP Breaker
Open (2/3 loops) reactor trip functions. The evaluation concluded that the discrete periods of TS 3.3.1 or TS 3.0.3 non-
compliance were as follows:
Unit(cid:9) Period(cid:9) Ch A(cid:9) Ch B(cid:9) Applicable TS
3(cid:9) 9/30/18 04:41 - 10/1/18 00:02 (19 hrs 21 min)(cid:9) X(cid:9) X(cid:9) TS 3.0.3

All FU20 ALT surveillances that could not be performed above their respective interlock power levels had been completed
regularly during outage conditions, which is consistent with the design of the Turkey Point RPS. There were no failures
during the surveillance testing and therefore no loss of safety function during the periods of TS non-compliance. At no
point had any completed surveillance frequency exceeded an 18-month fuel cycle.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE
The cause of this event is a latent gap within the test capabilities of the Turkey Point RPS. Although not compliant with the
SFCP frequencies, the practice of performing the ALT surveillances during outage conditions is consistent with the design
of the Turkey Point RPS.
SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE
The safety significance of this event is low. The subject ALT surveillances had been completed at frequencies that were
consistent with the design of the Turkey Point RPS. No test failures had occurred during the assessment period. The
actions to bring the SFCP frequencies into alignment with the RPS design did not require any additional surveillance
testing.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
All FU20 ALT surveillances that cannot be performed above their respective interlock power levels have been completed
during reactor shutdown conditions. The SFCP implementing procedure has been revised to assign an 18-month refueling
outage frequency to the subject FU20 ALT surveillances. All FU20 ALT surveillances are currently within their approved
performance frequencies. FU20 is fully operable.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
EIIS Codes are shown in the format [IEEE system identifier, component function identifier, second component function
identifier (if appropriate)].
SIMILAR EVENTS
A 5-year historical review of reportable events related to unrecognized inoperability of equipment required by Technical
Specifications was performed to identify similar events or patterns. No other cases of TS surveillance frequencies that
exceeded Tech Spec shutdown requirements were identified.
