In 2010, Nuclear Logistics (NLI) was contracted by V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) to replace its 3 safety-related
chillers. On June 28, 2021, V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) was notified that the bolted diagonal supports for the NLI
safety related chillers (XHX0001A/16/1C) have a bolt (the pin) which would not withstand the combined design seismic and
thermal loads. The vendor conclusion was confirmed by VCSNS personnel. As a result, the previous NLI chiller support frame
design does not meet required seismic qualification under VCSNS procurement specification for compliance with 10 CFR 50
Appendix A, Criterion 2. At the time of discovery, only the 'A' Chiller had been replaced. Additional support bracing was
designed, fabricated, and installed for the affected in-service 'A' Chiller. The enhanced bracing installation has corrected the
issue and restored compliance with Technical Specifications (TS). There were no seismic events of consequence to the 'A'
Chiller functionality during the time of the deficient seismic restraint (August 5, 2011 until June 29, 2021). However, there were
times when the 'A' Chiller was credited as a TS support component, resulting in the plant operating in a condition prohibited by
TS.

1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
In 2010, NLI (now a part of Paragon Energy Solutions) was contracted by V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) to
provide 3 replacement safety-related chillers. On June 28, 2021, Paragon Energy Solutions notified V.C. Summer
Nuclear Station (VCSNS) that the bolted diagonal supports for the NLI safety-related chillers (XHX0001A/1B/1C) have a
bolt (the pin) which cannot withstand the combined seismic and thermal loads. The deficiency was confirmed by VCSNS
personnel, following review of the vendor documentation. As a result, the NLI chiller support frame design did not meet
required seismic qualification under VCSNS procurement specification for compliance with 10 CFR 50 Appendix A,
Criterion 2. At the time of discovery, only the 'A' Chiller had been replaced. The 'B' Chiller was in the process of being
replaced. The 'C' Chiller (design unaffected by the defective seismic restraint) was operable, with its replacement being
fabricated by the vendor. This condition had existed for the 'A' Chiller since its seismic restraint was installed August 5,
2011. The 'A' Train of Chilled Water was declared non-functional at 1435 hrs on June 28, 2021 and the station entered
Technical Specification (TS) Action Statement 3.5.2.a.
Additional support bracing was designed, fabricated, and installed for the affected in-service 'A' Chiller. The action
statement was exited within the allowable 72-hour outage time on June 29, 2021 at 1030 hrs. The enhanced design was
applied to the 'B' Chiller, prior to its return to service, and will be applied to the replacement 'C' Chiller at the vendor
facility prior to its delivery and installation. The enhanced bracing installation has corrected the issue and brought the
issue in line with VCSNS seismic design specifications. There were no seismic events of consequence to the 'A' Chiller
functionality during the time of the deficient seismic restraint.
2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS
Although not specifically addressed in TS, Safety Related Chilled Water is required for operability of TS-required
equipment. The 'A' Chiller seismic restraint was installed August 5, 2011 and subsequently credited as a TS support
component. A past functionality evaluation performed on the 'A' Chiller determined the 'A' Chiller was non-functional, as
a result of inadequate seismic restraints, from August 5, 2011 to June 29, 2021. During this period, there were
occasions when 'A' Chiller was one of two chillers credited for support of the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS)
equipment, required per TS 3.5.2. The most-limiting ECCS component supported by the Safety Related Chilled Water
are the charging pumps. The non-functional 'A' Chiller could have also impacted availability of the Control Room
Emergency Filtration System (CREFS) (TS 3.7.6) and potentially other safety-related equipment for some scenarios.
These past condition(s) prohibited by TS were not known until Paragon submitted the Part 21 information on June 28,
2021. There were no seismic events of consequence to the 'A' Chiller functionality during the time of the deficient
seismic restraint (August 5, 2011 until June 29, 2021).
The Chilled Water System provides cooling to safety-related areas (TS Table 3.7-7) as an attendant cooling system and
supports the comfort requirements for the Control Room Emergency Filtration Systems (CREFS). The Chilled Water
System is necessary to ensure equipment located within these areas can withstand the environmental effects of a
postulated FSAR chapter 15 event.

NARRATIVE
The 'A' Chiller (XHX0001A) is designed to provide a continuous flow of 45 deg F chilled water to various safety-related
cooling coils in the plant during both normal and emergency conditions. All TS areas in Table 3.7-7, with the exception of
Areas 23-30 (cooled by outside air ventilation), are cooled by chilled water air handling units. If the temperature limits for
any room listed in TS Table 3.7-7 are exceeded for more than eight hours, a Special Report demonstrating operability of
the pertinent equipment is required per TS 3.7.9.a. If those values are exceeded by more than 30 deg F for more than 4
hours the equipment in the room is considered inoperable per TS 3.7.9.b.
In order for the 'A' Chiller to continuously deliver 45 deg F water, all heat loads generated in the areas served by the
Chilled Water System must be transferred to the chilled water fluid, and absorbed by the refrigeration system, which is
then rejected to the Service Water System. The 'A' Chiller is designed to provide this function under all operating
scenarios.
Therefore, it is required to operate continuously, when started on demand, and the total heat removal rate (cooling
capacity) must meet or exceed the total steady-state heat load rates for the Chilled Water System supported areas. This
is required during both normal and accident heat load conditions, provided the system is Seismic Category I components.
3.0 CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The cause of the non-functionality was the inadequate seismic design for bracing on the installed 'A' Chiller, as well as
for the 'B' was in the process of being installed. Specifically, the issue was the bolts (pins) utilized in the seismic bracing
design were not adequate for the design load.
4.0 CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Additional support bracing was designed, fabricated, and installed for the affected in-service 'A' Chiller. This modification
was completed on the installed 'A' Chiller on June 29, 2021. The same design modification was applied to the 'B' Chiller
prior to its return to service and will be applied to the enhanced 'C' Chiller prior to its installation. The enhanced seismic
restraint has corrected the issue, restoring compliance with the VCSNS seismic design and TS.
VCSNS personnel have engaged with Paragon regarding the design and fabrication of its chillers and continue to provide
oversight in accordance with procurement and quality assurance program requirements.

NARRATIVE
5.0 SIMILAR EVENTS
A review of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) and condition reports (CRs) at VCSNS for the three previous years did not
identify any similar events.
6.0 MANUFACTURER / MODEL INFORMATION
Paragon/Nuclear Logistics (NLI) 280-ton Custom Chillers, Serial Numbers XHX-0001A, XHX-0001B, and XHX-0001C.
The Chillers were originally supplied to VC Summer Nuclear Station by Nuclear Logistics under purchase order
NU-02SR726683 in 2010.
7.0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
While this LER describes a condition that could have had adverse impacts to equipment qualification following a seismic
event, there was no such event. As a result, the chilled water system and the equipment it supports were not impacted
by the design vulnerability that has now been corrected.
