At 1036 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on 8/18/2021, Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) experienced a reactor trip due to
low level in the 'B' steam generator. WCGS was operating in MODE 1 at 100% power when the trip occurred. ENS notification
#55416 was made at 1251 CDT in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)
(A) for an auxiliary feedwater system actuation. All control rods dropped, all equipment functioned as designed, and offsite
power remained available.
The direct cause was a fracture of the valve stem for the 'B' steam generator main feedwater regulating valve, causing the valve
to fail closed and resulting in a loss of feed flow control to the ‘B’ steam generator. The hardware failure anaylsis performed on
the valve stem determined that the fracture was due to a fatigue crack which had propagated through the stem of the valve. Tool
marks within the thread root, as well as the thread root being cut deeper and narrower were identified as stress risers which
allowed the crack to propagate into the material of the stem.
Dye penetrant testing of the replacement stem, and on the existing valve stems of the three other main feedwater regulating
valves, showed no relevant indications.

NARRATIVE
PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENTS
The plant was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power when the reactor tripped. No systems, structures, or components
(SSCs) were inoperable at the beginning of the event which contributed to the event.
DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S)
Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes and component codes are identified in the text as [XX].
The main feedwater regulating valves (MFRVs) [SJ-FCV] are air operated angle valves which automatically control
feedwater flow to the steam generators (SGs) [SB-SG] between 30 percent and full power. The MFRVs are located in the
turbine building. The MFRVs also can provide backup isolation of main feedwater flow in the event that a main feedwater
isolation valve (MFIV) [SJ-ISV] fails to close.
Closure of the MFIVs or MFRVs terminates flow to the SGs, in the event of a feedwater line break occurring upstream of
the MFIVs or MFRVs. Since the MFIVs are located upstream of the point where the auxiliary feedwater lines connect to
the main feedwater lines, which is in turn upstream of the main feedwater check valves (located in Area 5 inside the
auxiliary building), closure of the MFIVs or the MFRVs ensures delivery of auxiliary feedwater to the SGs for support of the
auxiliary feedwater function in the event of a main feedwater line break in the turbine building.
AEFCV0520 is the MFRV on the main feedwater line which feeds the 'B' SG and has a Copes-Vulcan actuator. The
actuator valve stem is made from ASTM A276 Type 316 Condition B stainless steel with a 1" in diameter and 8 UNC-2A
threads.
EVENT DESCRIPTION
Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power on August 18, 2021, when at 1035
Central Daylight Time (CDT), feed water flow began dropping. As a result of the lower flow, valve demand increased
which caused the valve position indication to increase. The balance-of-plant (BOP) operator reported that going to
manual would not change the course of the transient as the signal was responding properly to actual level decrease. The
BOP operator was then directed to trip the plant based on loss of flow indication. But prior to taking action, SG 'B' level fell
below the low SG level reactor trip and main feedwater isolation set point of 23.5 percent and at 1036 CDT, the reactor
automatically tripped. This resulted in a Main Feedwater Isolation and an Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation. All control rods
dropped, all required safety systems functioned as designed, and offsite power remained available.
BASIS FOR REPORTABILITY
The reactor trip and actuation of Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) instrumentation actuation
described in this event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), which requires reporting of "Any event or condition that
resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a) (2) (iv) (B) of this section..."
Paragraph (B)(1) of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) includes "Reactor Protection System (RPS) including: reactor scram or reactor
trip." Paragraph (B)(6) of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) includes "PWR auxiliary or emergency feedwater."
ENS notification 55416 was made at 1251 CDT on August 18, 2021, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), which
requires notification within 4 hours, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) which requires notification within 8 hours.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE
The direct cause was a fatigue crack propagated through the stem of AEFCV0520, causing the stem to fracture, resulting
in a loss of feed flow control to the ‘B’ Steam Generator.
The root cause was tool marks within the thread root caused local stress risers, which allowed multiple cracks to initiate.
In addition, the thread root was also cut deeper and narrower than allowed by specification. This created an additional
stress riser which allowed the cracks to propagate into the body of the valve stem.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Actions taken:
AEFCV0520 was disassembled and then reassembled with a replacement valve stem. The replacement valve stem was
satisfactorily inspected (no visible indications) using dye penetrant testing prior to installation. Dye penetrant testing of the
stems on the other three main feedwater control valves was also performed to look for surface indications of cracking. No
relevant indications were identified on any of the other three stems.
Actions planned:
A new Preventive Maintenance (PM) activity will be created to replace the stems on the four MFRVs on a 7.5-year
interval. The frequency of 7.5 years for this time-directed stem replacement PM was set based on the life span of the
valve stem that failed, and therefore considers a valve stem with sharper than allowed threads and tooling marks. In
addition, a methodology and scope for verifying root depth of threads on replacement stems for critical valves will be
implemented.
SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE
There were no safety consequences impacting plant or public safety from this event. All control rods dropped, offsite
power remained available, and all safety equipment operated appropriately and as designed. There was no loss of any
function that would have prevented fulfillment of actions necessary to: shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a safe
shutdown condition, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an
accident.
