On September 13, 2021, at 1822 EDT, an apparent non-compliance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Section III.G.2 (separation
of redundant fire safe shutdown equipment) was identified based on Operating Experience (OE) from North Anna Power
Station (LER 2021-002-00). A review of the affected control circuits for the Unit 1 and Unit 2 Emergency Diesel Generator
(EDG) output breakers and Emergency Bus feeder breakers identified a concern that damage to the control power circuits
during a fire may affect the ability to provide emergency power on both units. An 8-hour non-emergency report was made per
10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) for an unanalyzed condition. Fire watches were established in the affected areas.
The cause of this condition is the station’s original post-fire safe shutdown analysis did not accurately assess the impact on the
equipment from associated cable damage due to fire for the select cables. Risk mitigating actions have been developed,
implemented, and will continue to be performed until appropriate permanent corrective actions are in place to mitigate this
condition.
This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) for “Any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear
power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety.”

1.0 Description of Event
On September 13, 2021, at 1822 EDT, an apparent non-compliance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Section III.G.2
(separation of redundant fire safe shutdown equipment) was identified based on Operating Experience (OE) from North
Anna Power Station (LER 2021-002-00). A review of the affected control circuits for the Unit 1 and Unit 2 Emergency
Diesel Generator (EDG) output breakers (EIIS Component BKR, System EK) and Emergency Bus feeder breakers
(EIIS Component BKR, System EK) identified a concern that damage to the control power circuits during a fire may
affect the ability to provide emergency power on both units. An 8-hour non-emergency report was made per 10 CFR
50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) for an unanalyzed condition (EN #55459). This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) for “Any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition
that significantly degraded plant safety.”
Several control cables were identified within common fire areas that, if fire damaged, could prevent the availability of
both trains of Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) (EIIS Component DG, System EK) to start and power their
respective emergency buses (EIIS Component BU, System EB) required by the station's current Appendix R analysis.
The following issues were found:
1. Fire damage to control power cables for normal supply breakers may result in loss of control power and inability
to power the emergency bus without manual operator actions outside of the main control room.
2. Hot shorts on the normal supply breakers (EIIS Component BKR, System EK) could result in spurious breaker
operations that may prevent EDGs and/or emergency buses from performing its Appendix R function.
2.0 Significant Safety Consequences and Implications
No significant safety consequences resulted from this event. Surry Appendix R analysis assumes all equipment within the
fire area or zone is damaged; however, it is expected that damage would be minimized due to the defense in depth
strategy for fire protection. Installed fire protection features are provided within the areas of concern to ensure fire damage
to the impacted control cabling is minimized. All affected fire areas have installed area-wide fire detection and installed
suppression systems. During this timeframe, Surry Units 1 and 2 operated at 100% power. The health and safety of the
public were not affected by this event.
3.0 Cause of the Event
The cause of this condition is the station's original post-fire safe shutdown analysis did not accurately assess the impact on
the equipment from associated cable damage due to fire for the select cables. In addition, the original Multiple Spurious
Operations review effort failed to recognize applicability of EDG/Emergency Power scenarios for some areas for the plant.

4.0 Immediate Corrective Action
Fire watches were established in the Unit 1 Normal Switchgear Room, Unit 1 Cable Tray Room, Unit 1 Emergency
Switchgear Room, and Unit 2 Cable Vault and Tunnel to mitigate the risk of fire and aid in early detection of fire. Risk
mitigating actions have been developed, implemented, and will continue to be performed until appropriate permanent
corrective actions are in place to mitigate this condition.
5.0 Additional Corrective Actions
A Reasonable Assurance of Safety (RAS) was developed with risk mitigating actions implemented until final resolution is
completed. Procedures ECA-0.0 (Loss of All AC Power) and Flex Support Guidelines (FSGs) were reviewed to mitigate
the results of a loss of all AC power conditions. Periodic reviews of applicable procedures and Fire Fighting Strategies for
fires in areas of concern have been established. Prior to any unavailability of the Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater
(TDAFW) pump (EIIS Component P, System BA), guidance has been provided to pre-stage the Beyond Design Basis
(BDB) Auxiliary Feedwater Pump.
The station is currently evaluating design changes to eliminate the vulnerability.
6.0 Actions to Prevent Recurrence
The applicable control cables associated with the EDG output breakers and Emergency Bus normal feeder breakers are
planned to be modified or manual actions are planned to be established, where applicable, to regain compliance as
required by Appendix R Safe Shutdown Analysis.
7.0 Similar Events
A review of internal operating experience was performed, and no similar events were identified that were previously
reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
8.0 Additional Information
Units 1 and 2 continued to operate at 100% power.
