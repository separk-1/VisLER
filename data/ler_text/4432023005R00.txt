On November 07, 2023, during normal operation, Seabrook Station declared the Auxiliary Feedwater System inoperable
because control power to the 'B' train Emergency Feedwater (EFW) flow control valve, which supplies the 'D' Steam
Generator (SG), was lost. The 'B' transformer providing control power to the EFW circuit was identified as the failure
mechanism. Failure of any of the eight EFW flow control valves to meet its Surveillance Requirements will render all EFW
pumps inoperable per Technical Specifications.
This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) as any event or condition that at the time of discovery
could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to remove residual
heat.

NARRATIVE
Description:
On November 07, 2023 at 1200 EST, with Unit 1 in MODE 1 at 100 percent power, it was discovered that the red open
lights for the 'B' train Emergency Feedwater (EFW) flow control valve [BA, FCV] 1-FW-FV-4244B were not illuminated on
the Main Control Board (MCB) or on the Remote Shutdown System (RSS) panel. Loss of control power to the flow control
valve represents a failure to meet Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.7.1.2.1.c, which required
declaring the Emergency Feedwater Pumps [BA, P] inoperable. Consequently, this event was reportable pursuant to 10
CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function needed to remove
residual heat.
Cause of the Event:
The loss of control power to the flow control valve was a result of a failed transformer in the motor control center. Without
control power, the automatic high-flow isolation design function was challenged. In the supply line to the ‘D’ Steam
Generator (SG), two flow control valves are arranged in series, each powered from separate 120V sources. Train ‘B’
control power was lost but train ‘A’ control power remained available. Train 'A' control power preserved the EFW system's
capability to supply all of the SGs or to isolate a supply line. Upon transformer and fuse replacement, the EFW system
was declared operable.
Analysis of the Event:
The EFW system is comprised of two 100% capacity pumps (one motor-driven and one turbine-driven). Both pumps
discharge to a common header which feeds four branch lines to the SGs. Each branch line includes a manual gate
isolation valve, two motor-operated flow control valves, a flow venturi and a flow orifice. The flow control valves are
normally open while in operation and closed in the event of a pipe break. Each branch line has two flow control valves in
series and they are powered from separate trains. Each of these valves are also provided with a handwheel to allow for
manual operation. The EFW system has sufficient redundancy to maintain its safety-related functions under all credible
accident conditions.
Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.7.1.2.1.c. to verify that each automatic valve in the flow path
actuates to its correct position upon receipt of an EFS actuation test signal, was not met. The TS rendered the EFW
system inoperable but redundancy allowed for the system to retain its safety functions.
Safety Significance:
This event was of very low safety significance because the flow control valves are arranged in series, with separate
control power sources, assuring that the system's safety functions would have been met. There were no adverse effects to
the health and safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, or radiological safety. The station remained in steady-
state power operation.
Corrective Actions:
The failed transformer was replaced.

NARRATIVE
Failed Component:
Gould ITE Machine Tool Transformer, 0.100 kVA 480/120V
Safety System Functional Failure Consideration:
This event required reporting under the criterion of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) because of the failure to meet the TS SR.
However system redundancy preserved the EFW system safety functions. Consequently, this event will not be included in
the Station's Performance Indicator (PI) reporting in accordance with NEI 99-02.
Similar Events:
Seabrook Station has experienced no similar events in the past three years.
