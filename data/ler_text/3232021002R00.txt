On October 15, 2021, at 17:49 Pacific Daylight Time, with Diablo Canyon Power Plant Unit 2 operating at
90 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped in accordance with plant procedures due to
increasing water level in Feedwater Heater (FWH) 2-5B.
This event included actuation of the auxiliary feedwater system as expected following manual reactor trip.
This event is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a manual reactor trip and the associated
automatic actuation of a specified safety system.
The cause of the increased feedwater level was due to failure of multiple tubes in the FWH.
There was no impact to the health and safety of the public or plant personnel.

NARRATIVE
I. Reporting Requirements
This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) and the associated guidance of
NUREG-1022, Revision 3, due to a manual reactor trip and the subsequent automatic actuation of the auxiliary
feedwater (AFW) system as expected.
This event was initially reported in Event Notification 55526 in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR
50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) as a manual actuation of the reactor protection system and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) as an
automatic actuation of a specified safety system.
II. Plant Conditions
At the time of the event, Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 90 percent power.
III.P roblem Description
A. Background
The condensate system and main feedwater system (MFWS) are non-safety-related systems whose function is
to supply preheated feedwater to the steam generators (SGs). These systems improve overall plant efficiency
by regeneratively heating feedwater as it is pumped through low and high-pressure feedwater heaters (FWHs)
prior to the entering the SGs. The condensate and MFWS are not required to ensure safe shutdown of the
nuclear steam supply system.
The condensate and MFWS receive condensate from the main condenser hotwell and deliver it as feedwater to
the SGs at the required pressure and temperature. Condensate is normally pumped to the main feedwater
pump suction header through FWHs 2 through 6. Feedwater is then pumped through the tube sides of FWH 1.
Extraction steam from the low and high-pressure turbines is piped to the shell sides of these feedwater heaters.
All FWHs are horizontal type with three parallel heat exchangers comprising each level of FWH heating.
The AFW system is an engineered safety system that serves as a backup supply of feedwater to the secondary
side of the SGs when the condensate and MFWS are not available, thereby maintaining the heat sink
capabilities of the steam generators.
B. Event Description
On October 15, 2021, at 17:49 Pacific Daylight Time, with DCPP Unit 2 operating at 90 percent power, while
diagnosing a potential tube leak in FWH 2-5B, the reactor was manually tripped in accordance with plant
procedures due to increasing water level in the feedwater heater.

C. Status of Inoperable Structures, Systems, or Components that Contributed to the Event
This event included actuation of the AFW system as expected following manual reactor trip. There were no
inoperable Technical Specification structures, systems, or components that contributed to the event.
D. Method of Discovery
Increased water level in FWH 2-513 was validated by Operations personnel following the receipt of the
associated control room annunciator.
E. Operator Actions
The Operations crews responded to this event in accordance with plant operating procedures.
F. Safety System Responses
The AFW system responded as expected following the manual reactor trip.
IV. Cause of the Problem
The cause of the water level increase was a result of multiple tube failures in FWH 2-513.
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no safety consequences as a result of this event.
There was no impact on health and safety of the public or plant personnel.
VI. Corrective Actions
FWH 2-513 was repaired and returned to service. The other two No. 5 FWHs (2-5A and 2-5C) were verified to
exhibit no indication of leakage. Follow-up corrective actions to prevent recurrence will be managed in
accordance with the DCPP Corrective Action Program.
VII. Additional Information
There have been no similar events at DCPP in the previous three years.
