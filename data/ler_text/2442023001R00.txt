On 04/11/2023 at 1320, during an Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) B Load / Safeguard Sequence Test, safety related Bus
17 did not load onto EDG B following receipt of a Safety Injection signal. As the plant was in MODE 5 where Technical
Specifications (TS) 3.8.2 requires only one operable EDG, there was no immediate consequence to plant operation, but a
corroded/bound breaker shunt trip attachment (STA) plunger discovered upon investigation indicated that the breaker would not
have operated earlier. The last successful trip of the EDG B breaker was in MODE 1 on 04/06/2023 at 0543 during routine
surveillance testing.
MODE 5 was achieved at 04/10/2023 at 1507; consequently, for 4 days 9.4 hours, two operable EDGs were required per TS
3.8.1, but only one EDG was operable (except on 04/07/2023 when EDG A was inoperable for identical routine surveillance
testing, and, for 4 hours 11 minutes, no EDGs were operable). The resultant violations of TS 3.8.1 Conditions B.1, B.3.1, and
B.3.2 are reportable as Conditions Prohibited by TS [50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)] and E.1 as an Event or Condition that Could Have
Prevented Fulfillment of a Safety Function [50.73(a)(2)(v)].
Corrective actions include changing breaker maintenance procedures to replace rather than clean corroded STA plungers.

NARRATIVE
I.P RE-EVENT PLANT CONDITIONS
At the time the condition was identified, the plant was in MODE 5 at 0% rated thermal power.
II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
A. EVENT
On 4/11/2023, the station was in Mode 5 (Cold Shutdown) for a refueling outage. During the performance of Train B
surveillance STP-O-R-2.2-TR-B, Diesel Generator Load and Safeguard Sequence Test, Bus 17 did not load onto
Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) B following a Safety Injection (SI) signal. Main Control Board (MCB) alarms L-15
(Bus 17 Under Voltage Safeguards) and L-13 (Safeguard Bus D/G Breaker Overcurrent Trip) were received. The alarm
switch for breaker 52/EG1B2 was found actuated but with no Amptector targets indicated. A recorder set up during the
test showed that the breaker tripped free (closed and then immediately reopened).
With the breaker racked out, inspection of the STA moving core identified that the plunger was entirely coated in surface
rust, was not fully reset from the previous trip of the breaker, and was preventing future breaker closure, thus causing it to
be inoperable. Upon identification of the STA moving core rust, the breaker was immediately replaced with a spare
breaker of the same type and model. Following a successful test, system operability was restored.
Only one EDG is required in MODE 5 per Technical Specification 3.8.2; thus, there was no immediate consequence to
plant operation. Two EDGs are required to supply SI loads during a Design Basis Accident (DBA) in MODES 1-4 based
on Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1.
B. INOPERABLE STRUCTURES, COMPONENTS, OR SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT:
No other Systems, Structures, or Components (SSCs) were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the
event.

C. DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES OF MAJOR OCCURENCES:
04/06/2023 @ 0543 (MODE 1) last successful trip of the breaker 52/EG1B2 (supply breaker for Bus 17 from EDG B).
04/07/2023 @ 1113 EDG ‘A’ removed from service until 1151 for STP-O-30.10 (Pre-startup Alignment). EDG ‘A’ declared
inoperable.
04/07/2023 @ 1202 EDG ‘A’ removed from service until 1535 for STP-O-12.1 (EDG ‘A’ Monthly Testing). EDG ‘A’
declared inoperable.
04/10/2023 @ 1507 MODE 5 achieved.
04/10/2023 @ 2200 (MODE 5) Began STP-O-R-2.2-TR-B.
04/11/2023 @ 1320 (MODE 5) Self-revealing failure of 52/EG1B2.
04/12/2023 @ 0940 Breaker 52/EG1B2 replaced; EDG B returned to operable status.
D. OTHER SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS AFFECTED:
None
E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY:
Self-revealing: During the performance of STP-O-R-2.2-TR-B, Diesel Generator Load and Safeguard Sequence Test, Bus
17 did not load onto EDG B following SI initiation. At the time MCB alarms L-15, Bus 17 Under Voltage Safeguards, and
L-13, Safeguard Bus D/G Breaker Overcurrent Trip, were received.
F. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES:
No safety systems actuated, as expected.
III. CAUSE OF EVENT:
The direct cause of the failure of the circuit breaker to close and remain closed when demanded was the failure of the
breaker shunt trip attachment (STA) to reset to its shelf condition following a trip due to surface corrosion on the STA
moving core causing friction between the core and coil.
IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE SAFETY CONSEQUENCES OF THE EVENT:
Based on the date/time of the last successful trip of the breaker in MODE 1 on 04/06/2023 at 0543, the plant had one
EDG operable when two were required to be operable per TS 3.8.1 until MODE 5 was achieved on 04/10/2023 at 1507, at
total of 4 days 9.4 hours, including a 4-hour 11-minute period on 04/07/2023 when no EDG was operable due to EDG A
being declared inoperable for surveillance testing.

NARRATIVE
The resultant violations of TS 3.8.1 Conditions B.1, B.3.1, and B.3.2 are reportable as Conditions Prohibited by TS
[50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)] and E.1 as an Event or Condition that Could Have Prevented Fulfillment of a Safety Function [50.73(a)
(2)(v)].
As the plant never lost offsite power during the 4-day 9.4-hour period in MODE 1 when one or no EDG was operable when
two were required to be operable, safety related busses always had power resulting in no actual safety consequences of
the event. During the time between MODE 5 and discovery of the failed STA, EDG A was always operable, so TS were
satisfied. As such, this event is not considered to have had any significant effect on the health and safety of the public.
V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The breaker was replaced with a spare unit under Work Order (WO) C93909101 on 04/12/2023.
Extent of condition was performed under WO C93910116. The EDG A breaker STA was found in excellent condition and
cycled as expected.
Add guidance to breaker maintenance procedures to inspect for corrosion and free operation of the STA moving coil. If
any STA does not meet acceptance criteria on a Screenhouse breaker, replace the STA.
VI. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
This failure was documented in Corrective Action Program Issue Report (IR) 04669299.
A. FAILED COMPONENTS:
52/EG1B2, Supply breaker for Bus 17 from EDG B.
B. PREVIOUS LERs ON SIMILAR EVENTS:
A search of all Ginna LERs submitted to the NRC determined there have been no prior LERs reporting similar breaker
failure.
