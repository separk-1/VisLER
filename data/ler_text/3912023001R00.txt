16. Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On May 25, 2023 at 1345 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), operations personnel were verbally notified that a fire
barrier for area 737-A1B was not installed, and would render the 2A Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) not
operable in the event of a fire on the Unit 2 side of elevation 737 in the Auxiliary Building. The 2A EDG is the
credited power source for fire safe shutdown for a fire located in this area. Without the credited source of power, this
placed Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 in an unanalyzed condition. A fire watch was established in the area
until the issue was resolved.
The cause is a legacy design issue which failed to recognize the Normal and Alternate Feeders share the same
breaker on the associated 480V shutdown board (2-BD-212-A1-A and 2-BD-212-A2-A). Permanent corrective
action by implementation of a design change was completed on June 10, 2023.The design change disconnected the
Alternate Feeder Cable for the Diesel Auxiliary Boards from the associated 480V Shutdown Board. Therefore, a fire
in fire area 737-A1B would no longer trip the common breaker and the 2A EDG would remain operable.

A. Event Summary
On May 25, 2023 at 1345 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), operations personnel were verbally
notified that a fire barrier for area 737-A1B was not installed, and would render the 2A
Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) [EIIS:DG] not operable in the event of a fire on the Unit 2

NARRATIVE
E. Other systems or secondary functions affected
None.
F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error
On May 25, 2023, WBN engineering personnel submitted CR 1858921 as a result of findings
while performing a Fire Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) for WBN.
G. The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component
No components failed associated with this event.
H. Operator actions
Operations instituted a fire watch following review of CR 1858921.
I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses
None.
III. Cause of the event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error
The cause is a legacy design issue which failed to recognize the Normal and Alternate
Feeders share the same breaker on the associated 480V shutdown board (2-BD-212-A1-A
and 2-BD-212-A2-A). Design Change 54192 issued in 2010 during Unit 2 completion rerouted
and wrapped the Normal Feeder but did not include the Alternate Feeder.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause
No human performance cause is attributed to this event.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the event
A legacy issue was discovered in the Unit 1 and 2 Appendix R Safe Shutdown Analysis. This
legacy issue stems from a resolution applied to the Normal Feeder Cables [EIIS:CBL] and
Alternate Feeder Cables for the 480V Diesel Auxiliary Boards 2A1-A and 2A2-A (2-MCC-215-
A001-A and 2-MCC-215-A002-A)[EIIS:SWGR]. The analysis failed to recognize the normal and

NARRATIVE
alternate feeders share the same breaker on the associated 480V shutdown board (2-BD-212-
A001-A and 2-BD-212-A002-A). The resolution was applied to the Normal and Alternate Feeder
Cables covering fire area 737-A1B (Unit 2 side of elevation 737). The resolution was incorrectly
applied to the alternate cables with no protection in fire area 737-A1B. This results in an
associated circuit that would result in loss of 480V Diesel Auxiliary Boards 2A1-A and 2A2-A by
tripping the common breaker on a short to ground fault during a fire in 737-A1B. This would result
in the loss of the 2A EDG, which is the credited power source for an Appendix R fire in this area
supporting Unit 2 safe shutdown. In the event the 2A EDG was lost, the existing station batteries
could support safe plant operation for several hours until a FLEX DG could be started and aligned
to the 2A 6.9kV Shutdown Board (SDBD).
V.(cid:9) Assessment of Safety Consequences
For an Appendix R fire in the area of concern, Unit 2 would have lost offsite power and its credited
onsite AC power source, the 2A EDG. Cooling for Unit 2 for this event is provided by the Turbine
Driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pump (TDAFWP)[EIIS:P]. Motor operated valving for the Unit 2
TDAFWP is powered by station batteries. The plant’s response would therefore have been
similar to that for a station blackout (SBO). Several hours would have been available to start and
load an installed FLEX diesel to the 2A 6.9 kV SDBD normally powered by the 2A EDG, allowing
for safe plant shutdown.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as
the components and systems that failed during the event
No components failed as a result of this issue. In the event of an Appendix R fire in the
location identified, WBN had the capability to load a FLEX diesel generator to the 2A 6.9kV
SDBD.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident
Appendix R events are analyzed with the plant at power, so this is not applicable.
C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service
Not applicable.

VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
This event was entered into the TVA Corrective Action Program and is being tracked under
Condition Report 1858921.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions
Immediate corrective actions were to institute a fire watch until the identified issue was
corrected.
B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce the probability of similar events
occurring in the future
Design change WBN-23-034 was implemented by Work Order (WO) 123783604 on June 10,
2023. The design change disconnected the Alternate Feeder Cable for the Diesel Auxiliary
Boards from the associated 480V Shutdown Board. Therefore, a fire in fire area 737-A1B
would no longer trip the common breaker. The normal feeder remains protected in this area.
VII. Previous Similar Events at the Same Site
Multiple Licensee Event Reports (LERs 390-2013-005-00, 390-2014-004-02, 390-2015-002-01,
and 390-2015-004-01) were submitted to NRC in 2014 and 2015 for Unit 1 related to unanalyzed
conditions associated with Appendix R. These issues were identified during the licensing of WBN
Unit 2. This LER is the first item identified for WBN Unit 2.

None.
IX. Commitments
