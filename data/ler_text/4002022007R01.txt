At 06:53 Eastern Daylight Time, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, in Mode 1, at sixteen percent power following
the completion of a refueling outage, an automatic reactor trip occurred due to an under-voltage condition on the 'A' reactor
coolant pump (RCP) and the 'C' RCP that resulted from a loss of power from the ‘A’ auxiliary bus. Power was lost from the 'A'
auxiliary bus while operators were performing a procedure to transfer power from the 'A' start-up transformer to the 'A' unit
auxiliary transformer (UAT). With the loss of power from the ‘A’ auxiliary bus, the ‘A’ main feedwater pump (MFP) tripped. The ‘B’
MFP was not in service and with the loss of the last running MFP, the auxiliary feedwater system actuated as designed. Safety
systems functioned as required. This event did not impact public health and safety. An investigation determined that the current
transformers (CTs) in the ‘1A-3’ cubicle were mis-wired, resulting in a differential current protective relay sensing the equivalent
of a differential current in the ‘C’ phase on the ‘A’ auxiliary bus. When current was applied through the ‘A’ UAT to the ‘1A-3’
cubicle, the differential current protective relay actuated, which actuated the lockout of the ‘A’ auxiliary bus. The wiring error
occurred during maintenance activities on the CTs that were reinstalled during the refueling outage. Corrective actions involved
rewiring of the CTs in accordance with design.

A. Background
Prior to the event, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was operating in Mode 1 at approximately sixteen
percent power. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the time of this event that
contributed to the event. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as “Any event or condition that resulted in
manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of [10 CFR 50.73]...” due to actuation
of the reactor protection system (RPS) [JC] and auxiliary feedwater system (AFWS) [BA]. All actuated safety systems
functioned as designed.
The onsite non-emergency electrical distribution system [EA] provides auxiliary power to buses [BUs] that are divided into
trains 'A' and 'B'. Under normal operating conditions, the ‘A’ train receives power through the ‘A’ unit auxiliary transformer
(UAT) [XFMR] and the ‘B’ train receives power through the ‘B’ UAT. During start-up and shutdown conditions, offsite
power is supplied to the ‘A’ and ‘B’ trains through the ‘A’ start-up transformer (SUT) and ‘B’ SUT. At the time of the event,
the ‘A’ auxiliary bus was supplying non-safety equipment loads that included the ‘A’ reactor coolant pump (RCP) motor
[AB P MO], ‘C’ RCP motor, ‘A’ condensate pump motor [SD P MO], ‘A’ condensate booster pump motor, and ‘A’ main
feedwater pump (MFP) motor [SJ P MO].
B. Event Description
At 06:53 Eastern Daylight Time, with HNP in Mode 1, at approximately sixteen percent power following completion of a
refueling outage, an automatic reactor trip occurred due to an under-voltage condition on the 'A' RCP and the 'C' RCP that
resulted from a loss of power from the ‘A’ auxiliary bus. Power was lost from the 'A' auxiliary bus while operators were
performing a procedure to transfer power from the 'A' SUT to the 'A' UAT. With the loss of power from the ‘A’ auxiliary bus,
the ‘A’ MFP tripped. The ‘B’ MFP was not in service and with the loss of the last running MFP, the AFWS actuated as
designed. Safety systems functioned as required. An investigation determined that the current transformers (CTs) [XCTs]
in the ‘1A-3’ cubicle were mis-wired, resulting in a differential current protective relay [87] sensing the equivalent of a
differential current in the ‘C’ phase on the ‘A’ auxiliary bus. When current was applied through the ‘A’ UAT to the ‘1A-3’
cubicle, the differential current protective relay actuated, which actuated the lockout of the ‘A’ auxiliary bus. The wiring
error occurred during maintenance activities on the CTs that were reinstalled during the refueling outage.
C. Causal Factors
The root cause of the CT wiring error was that the lift/land of leads for the CT maintenance was not performed in
accordance with procedural guidance that requires unique cable identifiers for each lead lifted to ensure the as-found
configuration would be replicated during the lead terminations. A contributing cause was that the lift/lead process lacked
sufficient rigor to ensure configuration control. It was determined that the post-maintenance testing (PMT) following the
maintenance activity was inadequate since it only included wire land verification. The development and approval of the
PMT did not adequately address the potential consequences of bus de-energization for an incorrectly wired CT. This
resulted in not identifying the need to perform additional checks or testing, which consequently led to not validating proper
CT configuration.

D. Corrective Actions
Corrective actions involved rewiring of the differential CTs in accordance with design. An extent of condition review was
completed on CT connections on other auxiliary buses that had maintenance completed in the refueling outage and no
additional wiring errors were identified.
Accountability actions for individuals involved in the development of the lift/land sheets that lacked unique cable identifiers
required by procedure will be completed. Maintenance personnel will receive training on lift/land sheet usage. Additionally,
procedural guidance to improve the lift/land process will be implemented. A standing order has already been implemented
to prescribe supervisor reviews of configuration control sheets prior to implementation, which will remain in effect until the
improved procedural guidance is implemented. Procedural guidance that clarifies the conditions for utilizing wire land
verification as a post-maintenance test to ensure risk has been evaluated will also be implemented.
E. Safety Analysis
Following the reactor trip, the 'A’ auxiliary bus was able to be reenergized from the ‘A’ SUT. The reactor trip was not
complex, with all safety systems functioning as designed during and following the reactor trip. The automatic reactor trip
had no impact on public health and safety. The plant is designed for a loss of main feedwater and plant systems
responded as expected for this condition.
F. Additional Information
There have been no events at HNP similar to the event documented in this LER in the past three years.
