On March 17, 2021, at 1004 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2
experienced an automatic reactor trip on a main turbine trip due to a main feed pump trip on low condenser
vacuum. Concurrent with the reactor trip, the Auxiliary Feedwater system actuated as designed. All control and
shutdown rods inserted properly and all safety systems responded as designed.
The direct cause of the event was failure of a close latch to maintain an Alternate Supply Breaker open after
installation in the Unit 2C Board. The Alternate Supply Breaker closed causing the Normal Supply Breaker to
open, de-energizing the Unit 2C Board. The 2C Condenser Circulating Water (CCW) Pump lost power causing
a reduction of CCW flow and subsequent main feed pump trip on low condenser vacuum. Corrective actions
include incorporating vendor enhancements to the breaker maintenance procedures.
This condition is being reported as a safety system actuation in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).

NARRATIVE
I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event
Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 was at 90 percent Rated Thermal Power (RTP). Unit 1 was
unaffected by this event.
II. Description of Event
A. Event Summary
On March 17, 2021, during the performance of a breaker swap Work Order, the Alternate
Supply Breaker [EIIS:BKR] on the Unit 2C Board [EIIS:EA] inadvertently closed and tripped
open upon installation. The Normal Supply Breaker opened as designed when the Alternate
Supply Breaker closed. This caused a loss of power to the non-safety related Unit 2C Board
and subsequent de-energization of the 2C Condenser Circulating Water (CCW) pump
[EIIS:P] and reduction of CCW flow to the plant.
The lower CCW flow caused condenser vacuum [EIIS:SH] to lower and resulted in a reactor
trip on a main turbine trip due to Main Feed Pump (MFP) trip on low condenser vacuum.
Concurrent with the reactor trip, all control and shutdown rods fully inserted, the Auxiliary
Feedwater (AWF) System [EIIS:BA] actuated as designed, and all safety systems
responded as designed. There were no complications associated with the reactor trip.
This event is being reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a safety system actuation of the Reactor Protection System
(RPS) and the AFW system.
B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event
and that contributed to the event
There were no safety related inoperable structures, components, or systems that
contributed to this event.
C. Dates and approximate times (Eastern Daylight Time [EDT]) of occurrences
Date Time Event

D. Manufacturer and model number of each component that failed during the event
General Electric - AM 7.2-500-6HB, - 6.9KV - 2000 Amp Magne-Blast Circuit Breaker,
Manufacture Date 5/27/1996.
E. Other systems or secondary functions affected
No other systems or secondary functions were affected.
F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error
The component failure became evident when the Alternate Supply Breaker inadvertently
closed after installation into the Unit 2C Board.
G. Failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component
Upon racking in, the 2C Alternate Supply Breaker charging motor energizes to compress the
breaker springs. The close latch maintains the springs in a charged state with the breaker
open. In this case, the close latch did not properly engage with the charging spring cam
roller to maintain the springs charged. When the engagement of the closed latch was not
obtained, the springs discharged, resulting in a mechanical closure of the breaker (no
electrical signal).
H. Operator actions
Operators reduced reactor power in response to lowering vacuum in the main condenser.
I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses
The Main Feed Pumps tripped on low condenser vacuum, which resulted in an automatic
Turbine and Reactor trip, and subsequent actuation of the AFW system.
III.(cid:9) Cause of the Event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error
The most probable cause of the unintentional closure of the Unit 2C Board Alternate Supply
Breaker was the inconsistent return of the close latch to the reset position as confirmed by
the closing latch adjusting screw not in contact with the frame when the closing latch rotated
to reset position (observation of breaker in shop during post event inspection). This was
most likely caused by internal friction on the close latch shaft and bearings and could be
further compounded by degraded spring tension on the latch.
This failure had no effect on any safety systems or functions.

B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause
No human performance root causes were identified for this event.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the Event
At the time of the event, the Unit 2 CCW system was operating at reduced margin with the 2D CCW
pump out of service for repairs. The loss of the additional CCW pump caused a pressure transient
in the plant condenser systems. Operators in the control room responded to the event and began
lowering reactor power to stabilize the plant. The MFP condenser vacuum lowered resulting in a
MFP trip which led to an automatic Turbine and Reactor trip from approximately 90 percent RTP.
V.(cid:9) Assessment of Safety Consequences
This event closely matches and is bounded by the Loss of Normal Feedwater event described in
the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). A probablistic risk review of this event shows
the risk from this trip is very small.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the
components and systems that failed during the event
Not applicable.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident
Not applicable.
C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed
time from the discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service
Not applicable.
VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
This event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) Corrective Action Program and
is being tracked under Condition Report 1679456.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions
The faulty breaker was removed from the Unit 2C Board and quarantined. As an
intermediate compensatory measure, breaker swaps on Normal and Alternate Supply
Breakers were put on hold pending an online risk evaluation.

B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring
in the future
The overhaul procedure will be enhanced to include replacing specific internal components
based on internal vendor operating experience. In addition, a step will be added to the
Close Latch Reset check which will simulate breaker installation to verify proper close latch
alignment.
VII.(cid:9) Previous Similar Events at the Same Site
LER 391/2016-005-00 describes a Unit 2 reactor trip that occurred on June 20, 2016, as a result of
a MFP trip on low condenser vacuum. This specific event was caused by a human performance
error.
LER 391/2020-005-00 describes an event where a normal feeder breaker failed to close during a
Shutdown Board transfer. This failure was due to a faulty switch contact internal to the breaker.
No similar inadvertent breaker closure events are known.
