16. Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On December 2, 2023, with both units operating at 100% power, the South Texas Project (STP) 345 kV south
switchyard electrical bus unexpectedly de-energized. The de-energization of the south bus resulted in a loss of power to
the Unit 2 standby transformer which was supplying power to the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) 4160V busses for
the Unit 2 B Train. The associated Emergency Diesel Generator 22 automatically started in response to the under-
voltage condition, as designed.
The cause of this event was the failure of a stand-off insulator occurring on Phase “A” in 13.8kV Terminal Cabinet. A root
cause could not be determined after Engineering evaluations. Corrective actions included replacing the insulator and
performing visual inspections of both the transformer and bus for signs of arcing and/or water intrusion. There were no
previous indications of issues with the insulator.
This event is reportable as an event which resulted in the automatic actuation of the Unit 2 emergency AC electrical power
systems. Additionally, all ESF equipment operated as designed.

NARRATIVE
I. Description of Reportable Event
A. Reportable event classification
This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in the valid actuation of an
emergency AC electrical power system (50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(8)).
B. Plant operating conditions before the event
Prior to the event on December 2, 2023, STP Unit 2 was at 100% power in Mode 1.
C. Status of structures, systems, and components that were inoperable at the start of the event and that contributed
to the event
No other structures, systems or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event.
D. Background information
The Offsite Electrical System consists of two standby transformers, the 138kV emergency transformer, two main
power transformers, 345kV lines connecting the main power transformers and the standby transformers to the
switch yard, the 345kV switch yard, nine 345kV transmission circuits from the South Texas Project Electric
Generating Station (STPEGS) 345kV switchyard to the interconnecting grids, and the 138kV radial line connected
to the 138kV emergency transformer. The transmission system provides reliable sources of offsite power for
supplying plant auxiliary power systems for plant startup, shutdown or at any time that power is unavailable from
the unit's main generator.
The standby transformers are individually supplied by separate and independent overhead 345kV ties from the
345kV switchyard. These 345kV ties to the standby transformers are connected by two separate 345kV busses
(north and south) in the switchyard. Each standby transformer has the capacity to supply all Engineered Safety
Features (ESF) busses in both Units and two 13.8kV auxiliary busses. These transformers can be shared between
Units 1 and 2 and can supply the two preferred power sources (the north and south 345kV busses).
Per STP Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1.1.e, with two of the above required offsite AC circuits inoperable,
within 24 hours restore at least one of the inoperable offsite sources to OPERABLE status or apply the
requirements of the Configuration Risk Management Program (CRMP) or be in at least HOT STANDBY within
the next 6 hours. Unit 2 entered Technical Specification Actions 3.8.1.1.e. in response to this event.
E. Narrative summary of the event
On 12/2/2023 at 06:10 Unit 2 Control Room received annunciators 10M2-B-3 "345kV South Bus Diff" and
10M2-A-4 "345kV BKR Y610 Trip". The Control Room observed indication that Switchyard Breaker Y610 had
tripped open, and the 345kV Switchyard South Bus was de-energized. The following Standby Transformer 2
relays tripped: 51N-ST2Y, both 85N relays, 86-ST2B, and 86-ST2A. Standby Transformer 2 experienced a lockout
resulting in Emergency Diesel Generator 22 (EDG22) starting to supply power to the standby bus. This resulted in
loss of two offsite sources due to one ESF bus not being connected to a load tap changer in automatic and standby
bus not being available. On 12/2/23 at 08:30 the 4160V Bus E2B was powered from U1 standby transformer. On
12/2/23 at 12:35 the South Bus was re-energized after CenterPoint (Transmission Distribution Service Provider)
opened disconnect S024 to remove Standby Transformer 2 from the South Bus.

NARRATIVE
F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error
This event was self-revealed when a bus lockout in the switchyard caused the loss of a credited offsite electrical
power source. This resulted in the automatic actuation of on-site emergency power sources (EDG).
II. Component failures
A. Failure Mode, mechanism, and effects of failed component
The failure mode was a phase-to-ground short. The protective relay detected the fault and cycled the breaker
which momentarily removed all voltage from the bus to isolate the south bus from the fault.
B. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error
Failure of a stand-off insulator occurred on Phase “A” in 13.8kV Terminal Cabinet. A specific cause could not be
determined.
C. Systems or secondary functions that were affected by the failure of components with multiple functions
The de-energization of the south bus disconnected Unit 2 standby transformer from the grid. Since this
transformer is the normal supply to Train B ESF bus, the resulting undervoltage condition initiated a partial loss
of offsite power (LOSP), which sent a valid actuation signal to the Unit 2 Train B Standby Diesel Generator 22.
D. Failed component information
• System: { XFMR }
• Component: { INS }
• Manufacturer: Crown Electric { Crown Electric }
• Model: {CE 10-0002}
III. Analysis of the event
A. Safety system responses that occurred
The loss of the Unit 2 standby transformer caused an undervoltage condition on the Unit 2 Train B 4.16kV bus, the
automatic start of the Unit 2 Train B Standby Emergency Diesel Generator 22 and the automatic sequenced loading
of ESF equipment.
B. Duration of safety system inoperability
When the south bus was de-energized, Unit 2 entered TS Action 3.8.1.1.e on December 2, 2023, at 0610 hours
due to two independent offsite circuits being inoperable – the switchyard south bus and ESF bus E2B were not
connected to their offsite source. Upon re-energization of ESF Bus E2B approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes
later at 0830 hours, Unit 2 exited TS Action 3.8.1.1.e and entered TS Action 3.8.1.1.a due to one independent
offsite circuit being inoperable. Unit 2 exited TS Action 3.8.1.1.a at approximately 4 hours and 5 minutes later at
1235 hours when the offsite circuits were declared operable following the restoration of the switchyard south bus
and Standby Transformer 2. Therefore, the total safety system inoperability duration was 6 hours and 25 minutes.

NARRATIVE
C. Safety consequences and implications
A quantitative analysis was used for Unit 2, which remained at full power for the duration of the event. The loss
of the south bus did cause a partial loss of offsite power leading to an ESF actuation in Unit 2. All mitigating
systems remained functional and there were no mitigating system failures as a result of the event. No fission
product barriers were challenged in Unit 2. The loss of the South Bus has no increase in Core Damage Frequency
(CDF) and Large Early Release Frequency (LERF) in Unit 2.
This event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite does rates, and there were no
personnel injuries or damage to any other safety-related equipment associated with this event. Therefore, there
was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.
IV. Cause of the event
The cause of the event was the failure of a stand-off insulator occurring on Phase “A” in 13.8kV Terminal Cabinet,
which resulted in a phase-to-ground fault and subsequent bus lock out. There were no previous indications of
issues with the insulator. Based on vendor recommendation, Electric Power Research Institute, Inc. (EPRI)
guidelines (TR-112784), Industry practices, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards,
these standoff insulators do not have a proposed replacement schedule and are expected to not fail. Visual
inspections and meggering the bus are the industry best preventative maintenance that ensure the insulators
remain reliable. STP's Preventative Maintenance (PM) program currently aligns with these recommendations.
Furthermore, EPRI guidance preventative maintenance is to perform visual inspections for any water intrusion
signs or damage to the bus, perform thermography bi-annually, and performing a partial discharge test following
maintenance. A review of the Unit 2 Standby transformer was performed for the prior 10 years and as found
condition codes and inspection values were all within tolerance with no adverse trend. No changes to STP’s PM
program are required and the consequence is aligned with the maintenance strategy.
V. Corrective actions
1. Replaced faulty insulator.
2. Performed electrical testing of the non-segregated phase bus.
3. Performed Doble Power factor testing of the transformer.
4. Performed visual inspections of both the transformer and bus for signs of arcing and/or water intrusion.
VI. Previous similar events
A review identified a similar event in 2022 involving a failed insulator owned by the Transmission Distribution
Service Provider, which resulted in a loss of the south switchyard electrical bus. STP submitted Licensee Event
Report 2022-001-00 in response to this event.
