On May 30, 2023, at 04:46, Millstone Power Station Unit 3 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power when an automatic
reactor trip occurred following a main generator turbine trip caused by a main generator ground fault. The direct cause of the
trip was a ground fault on “B” phase of the main generator output breaker (MGOB) due to a flashover event that happened
inside the “B” breaker pole fiberglass air supply tube. Air leaks in the breaker air system caused increased air compressor run
time resulting in undesired moisture and oil accumulation in the air supply tube that led to flashover. The affected fiberglass air
supply tube was replaced and air leaks were fixed in the air supply system. The actuation of the Reactor Protection System and
the Auxiliary Feedwater System is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a
manual or automatic actuation of systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B).

NARRATIVE
On May 30, 2023, at 04:46, Millstone Power Station Unit 3 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power when an
automatic reactor trip occurred following a main generator turbine trip. The main generator turbine trip was initiated by a
main generator protection system actuation from a ground fault. All control rods inserted on the trip. Following the trip,
main feedwater was isolated as designed, and auxiliary feedwater was automatically actuated to restore steam generator
levels. As designed, turbine bypass valves prevented challenging the main steam safety valves following the reactor trip.
All reactor coolant pumps continued to operate and reactor coolant system cold leg temperatures were maintained greater
than 550°F following the event.
A four-hour non-emergency notification was made for the actuation of the Reactor Protection System in accordance with
10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B). An eight-hour non-emergency notification was made for the actuation of the Auxiliary
Feedwater System in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(B).
All systems performed as expected with the exception of the condenser air ejector radiation monitor (ARC-RE21). The
radiation monitor momentarily spiked to 2.0E-5 uC/cc, which generated the high alarm until 04:48, when the trend lowered
to 5.5E-6 uC/cc to clear the high alarm. At 04:49, ARC-RE21 decreased to its pre-trip value of 3.4E-6 uC/cc. Chemistry
sampling performed on May 31, 2023, in accordance with primary to secondary leak rate surveillance procedure
(SP 3861), gave no indication of steam generator tube leakage.
The actuation of the Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System is being reported in accordance with
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of systems listed in 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B).
CAUSE
The direct cause of the trip was a ground fault on “B” phase of the MGOB due to a flashover event that happened inside
the “B” breaker pole fiberglass air supply tube. The supply tube receives air from a 500 psi pressure reducing cabinet,
which is supplied by a 3700 psi air receiver that is filled from either of two MGOB air compressors. Air leaks in the breaker
air system caused increased air compressor run time resulting in undesired moisture and oil accumulation in the air
supply tube that led to flashover.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
There were no safety consequences related to this event. As designed, turbine bypass valves prevented challenging the
main steam safety valves following the reactor trip. The maximum indicated steam generator pressure was 1082 psig,
which was well below the nominal opening pressure of the first main steam safety valves of 1185 psig. As designed,
following the trip, main feedwater was isolated and auxiliary feedwater responded to restore steam generator levels. All
reactor coolant pumps continued to operate and reactor coolant system cold leg temperatures were maintained greater
than 550°F following the event.
Following the reactor trip, the minimum post-trip pressurizer pressure was approximately 1980 psia, which is well above
the low pressurizer pressure setpoint of 1892 psia. The minimum pressurizer level was 32% immediately following the
reactor trip. There was no indication of steam generator tube leakage which was verified by chemistry sampling performed
on May 31, 2023 in accordance with SP 3861. No safety functions were challenged, and plant operation was maintained
within the bounds of Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15: Safety Analysis. This event did not challenge the health and
safety of the public or the environment.

NARRATIVE
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The affected fiberglass air supply tube from MGOB air compressor was replaced. The air supply system to the main
generator output breaker was inspected, moisture and oil accumulation were cleaned, and leaks in the air system were
repaired. Additional corrective actions will be taken in accordance with the station corrective action program.
PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES
On April 1, 2020, at Millstone Power Station Unit 3, an automatic reactor trip occurred following a main generator turbine
trip caused by a main generator ground fault. The cause of reactor trip was a ground fault on the “C” phase of the normal
station service transformer isolated phase bus duct due to water intrusion and buildup in an isolated phase bus duct
transition section which caused a turbine generator trip, and subsequently a reactor trip. The root cause and faulted
component of that event was different and therefore it is not a repeat event.
