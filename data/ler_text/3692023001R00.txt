On October 18, 2023, an actuation of the A Train Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) pump occurred while Unit 1 was in Mode 5 during
a planned refueling outage. Maintenance technicians were performing PT/0/A/4600/012 A (Train A Reactor Trip Breakers
Actuating Device Operational Test for Manual Trip Function) and removed the incorrect fuse in the 1A Solid State Protection
System (SSPS) cabinet, temporarily deenergizing Train A SSPS Slave Relays. This caused the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat
circuit to reset, and in turn, start the 1A AFW pump. The Automatic Recirculation Valve (ARV) provided the required flow path
for pump protection. Auxiliary Feedwater was not supplied to the respective Steam Generators due to the motor operated
discharge isolation valves (MOVs) being closed as required for current plant conditions.
At the time of the 1A AFW actuation, the Main Feedwater (MFW) pumps were in a tripped condition, and decay heat removal
was being provided by the 1A Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System. Both MFW pumps being in tripped status provided the
logic for the AFW actuation signal once the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit was reset.
Corrective actions included personnel accountability and reinforcement of human performance tools.

NARRATIVE
BACKGROUND
This event is being reported under the following criterion:
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of
the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B).” The Emergency Feedwater System is specified in paragraph
(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6).
The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER.
Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets.
Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA]:
The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically supplies feedwater to the SGs to remove decay heat
from the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) upon the loss of normal feedwater supply. The AFW mitigates the
consequences of any event with loss of normal feedwater. The design basis of the AFW is to supply water to
the SGs to remove decay heat and other residual heat by delivering at least the minimum required flow rate
to the SGs.
The AFW is designed to start automatically for any event requiring emergency feedwater. The AFW Motor
Driven Pumps will automatically provide feedwater when initiated on any of the following conditions:
1. Trip of both main feedwater pumps
2. AMSAC Actuation (AMSAC - Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) Mitigation System Activation
Circuitry)
3. Two out of four (2/4) low-low level alarms in any one SG
4. Initiation of a safety injection signal
5. Loss of power to the 4160V essential bus (Blackout)
The AFW Turbine Driven Pump will automatically provide feedwater when initiated on any of the following
conditions:
1. Two out of four (2/4) low-low level alarms in any two SGs
2. Loss of power to the 4160V essential bus (Blackout)
3. 1/1 detector from Standby Shutdown Facility (SSF) SG Wide Range Low-Low Level on 2/4 SGs (72%)
Technical Specification 3.7.5 governs the Auxiliary Feedwater System. Limiting Condition of Operation 3.7.5
requires three AFW trains to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3. In Mode 4 when the Steam Generators are
relied upon for heat removal, one motor driven AFW train is required to be operable.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On 10/18/23, two maintenance technicians were performing PT/0/A/4600/012 A (Train A Reactor Trip
Breakers Actuating Device Operational Test for Manual Trip Function). During this evolution, one technician
removed the incorrect fuse in the 1A SSPS cabinet, temporarily deenergizing Train A SSPS Slave Relays.
This caused the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit to reset and in turn start the 1A AFW Pump. The automatic
recirculation valve provided the required flow path for pump protection. Auxiliary Feedwater was not supplied
to the respective Steam Generators due to the motor operated discharge isolation valves (MOVs) being
closed as required for current plant conditions. After the inadvertent start of the 1A AFW pump, an Auxiliary
Operator (AO) was dispatched and verified a satisfactory pump start and no abnormal conditions associated
with the running pump.
At the time of the 1A AFW actuation, the MFW pumps were both secured and in a tripped condition. Decay
heat removal was being provided by the 1A Residual Heat Removal System which was maintaining reactor
coolant temperature at approximately 88.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Both MFW pumps being in tripped status
provided the logic for the AFW actuation signal once the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit was reset. Upon
actuation of the 1A AFW pump, the lead technician informed his supervisor of the incorrect fuse removal, and
both the supervisor and technician then notified the Control Room Supervisor (CRS) of the error.
Further investigation revealed that neither technician fully read the procedure step nor referenced an
included procedure enclosure to validate they were in the correct cabinet. The lead technician became
overconfident in thinking they were in the correct location based on previous work in that cabinet, and the
support technician became overconfident in the lead technician’s knowledge. Neither technician performed
correct component verification per station standards to ensure they fully understood the procedure step and
were on the correct component prior to taking action.
Sequence of Events (times are approximate)
• 10/15/23 13:08 – Unit 1 entered Mode 5
• 10/18/23 11:16 – The 1A AFW Pump started due to incorrect fuse removal
• 10/18/23 14:42 – The 1A AFW Pump was secured per OP/1/A/6250/002 (Auxiliary Feedwater
System)
• 10/18/23 15:18 – An eight-hour nonemergency notification to the NRC was made per 10 CFR
50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) due to a valid actuation of the 1A AFW Pump.

NARRATIVE
CAUSAL FACTORS:
Causal factors include inadequate human performance behaviors specifically related to procedure use and
adherence and verification practices. Additionally, maintenance leadership did not effectively reinforce the
importance of correct human performance behaviors in accordance with site standards.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
Immediate:
1. Operations verified a satisfactory pump start including an adequate recirculation flow path of the 1A
Auxiliary Feedwater pump.
Planned:
1. Appropriate accountability and remediation actions will be performed for the technicians involved.
2. Maintenance leadership will perform deliberate observations to reinforce adherence to site human
performance standards.
SAFETY ANALYSIS:
At the time of the AFW actuation, the MFW system was shut down and the steam generators were not being
relied upon for heat removal. Decay heat removal was being provided by the 1A RHR system. The plant
was in Mode 5 making preparations to enter Mode 4 from an extended refueling outage with new fuel in the
reactor and therefore, low decay heat. The AFW actuation signal that caused the 1A AFW actuation was not
required to be operable in Mode 5.
In conclusion, this event is considered to be of very low safety significance. The 1A AFW system responded
as designed to the inadvertent actuation. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
A search of previous similar events over the past three years revealed no other AFW automatic actuation
resulting from human performance error; therefore, this event is not recurring.
