On May 8, 2021, during startup from the 27th Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit 1 (BVPS-1) refueling outage, BVPS-1 entered
Mode 4 and then Mode 3 without satisfying Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.3, Containment Isolation Valves, Limiting Conditions
for Operation as required by LCO 3.0.1 and LCO 3.0.4. TS 3.6.3 LCO requires containment isolation valves be operable in
Modes 1, 2, 3 and 4. TS LCO 3.0.1 requires that LCOs be met during Modes or other specified conditions in the Applicability. TS
LCO 3.0.4 requires that with an LCO not met, entry into a Mode of applicability shall only be made when the associated actions
to be entered permit continued operation in the Mode for an unlimited period of time or when a risk assessment has been
performed determining that entry into the Mode is acceptable. Contrary to LCO 3.0.4, while in Mode 3, it was discovered that
containment isolation check valve 1QS-4 (quench spray pump discharge check valve) was inoperable. The check valve was
inadvertently left open during performance of a loop seal fill procedure while in Mode 5.
The root cause was determined to be a loss of configuration control of 1QS-4 due to human performance errors by the
Operations supervisor. The corrective action is to revise the loop fill procedure to direct that the check valves are added to the
containment penetration log when being restrained open. This event is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for
operation or condition prohibited by TS.

Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX].
BACKGROUND
Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.3, Containment Isolation Valves Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.3, Each
containment isolation valve shall be OPERABLE in Modes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Condition A, One or more penetration flow paths with one containment isolation valve inoperable. If not met, both
Required Actions apply: A.1 Isolate the affected penetration flow path by use of at least one closed and de-activated
automatic valve, closed manual valve, blind flange, or check valve with flow through the valve secured within 4 hours,
AND A.2 Verify the affected penetration flow path is isolated once per 31 days for isolation devices outside containment
AND prior to entering Mode 4 from Mode 5 if not performed within the previous 92 days for isolation devices inside
containment.
Also applicable is Condition D, Required Action and associated Completion Time not met. Required Actions: D.1 Be in
Mode 3 within 6 hours AND D.2 be in Mode 5 within 36 hours.
With TS LCO 3.6.3 not met, and BVPS-1 entering Modes of applicability, LCO 3.0.4 also applies. LCO 3.0.4, When an
LCO is not met, entry into a MODE or other specified condition in the Applicability shall only be made:
a. When the associated ACTIONS to be entered permit continued operation in the MODE or other specified condition in
the Applicability for an unlimited period of time;
b. After performance of a risk assessment addressing inoperable systems and components, consideration of the results,
determination of the acceptability of entering the MODE or other specified condition in the Applicability, and establishment
of risk management actions, if appropriate (exceptions to this Specification are stated in the individual Specifications); or
c. When an allowance is stated in the individual value, parameter, or other Specification.
This Specification shall not prevent changes in MODES or other specified conditions in the Applicability that are required
to comply with ACTIONS or that are part of a shutdown of the unit.
Per TS 3.6.3 Bases, the containment isolation valves form part of the containment pressure boundary and provide a
means for fluid penetrations not serving accident consequence limiting systems to be provided with two isolation barriers
that are closed on a containment isolation signal. Two barriers in series are typically provided for each penetration, one is
inside containment and the other is outside containment.
The quench spray [BE] pump discharge check valves are containment isolation [BD] valves per TS 3.6.3. During
performance of procedure 1OM-13.4.O, “Quench Spray Loop Seal Drain and Fill,” the check valve is secured open to
facilitate the evolution, and then returned to normal system arrangement (NSA) during procedure restoration. The quench
spray loop seals are used to prevent containment repressurization and to prevent draining water to the containment sump,
and they are required to be filled for the entire cycle of operation.
1QS-3 and 1QS-4 (Trains A and B Quench Spray Pump Discharge Check Valve) are the containment isolation valves
inside containment for their respective containment penetrations. The corresponding isolation valves outside containment
are MOV-1QS-101A and B, respectively.

NARRATIVE
DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
On May 8, 2021, BVPS-1 was in Mode 3 and starting up from the 27th refueling outage. During the boric acid program
containment walkdowns in support of plant startup, 1QS-4 (Train B Quench Spray Pump Discharge Check Valve) was
found to be restrained open by its swing arm when it was expected to be unrestrained and closed per its NSA position.
The restraint had been placed in accordance with procedure 1OM-13.4.O to support filling the quench spray loop seal
prior to startup from the refueling outage and had not been removed prior to entering a mode of applicability for the
containment isolation TS LCO 3.6.3. This resulted in the associated containment penetration being declared inoperable
and an unplanned LCO action statement entry for LCO 3.6.3. Additionally, LCO 3.0.1 and LCO 3.0.4 were not met when
the plant entered two modes of applicability while not meeting LCO 3.6.3.
BVPS-1 entered Mode 4, the first Mode of applicability, on May 8, 2021 at 0356. Mode 3 was subsequently entered at
1028. The condition was discovered and the TS LCO 3.6.3 Condition A was entered on May 8, 2021 at 1406. The restraint
was removed and LCO 3.6.3 Condition A was exited at 1541. Prior to discovery, the containment penetration was
inoperable for 10 hours and 10 minutes. The valve was restored 1 hour and 35 minutes after discovery, for a total
inoperability time of 11 hours and 45 minutes. No other equipment or systems were inoperable which contributed to this
event. The quench spray system train B remained operable.
CAUSE OF EVENT
The direct technical cause was that 1QS-4 was restrained out of NSA per procedure 1OM-13.4.O and not returned to NSA
following filling of the loop seal. The root cause was a loss of configuration control of valve 1QS-4 due to human
performance errors by the Operations supervisor, who did not meet the requirements of procedure 1/2-ADM-2028,
"Temporary Configuration Control," and procedure NOP-OP-1002, "Conduct of Operations," for logging system conditions.
In the days leading up to the event, the plant was performing outage activities and activities required for plant startup. One
of these activities was filling of the quench spray loop seals per procedure 1OM-13.4.O. As part of this procedure, the
quench spray pump discharge check valve is restrained open to support gravity filling of the loop seal from the refueling
water storage tank (RWST). The loop seal level is then verified by ultrasonic non-destructive examination (NDE) and the
valve is returned to NSA per the restoration steps of 1OM-13.4.O. Similar procedures that restrain open containment
isolation valves contain steps to add the applicable containment penetrations to the containment penetration log when the
procedures are worked, no such steps are included in 1OM-13.4.O.
On April 30, 2021, NDE identified that the loop seals on both trains of quench spray needed to be filled. This fill was
planned to follow the Type A containment surveillance test which prevented access to containment. Following the
surveillance, procedure 1OST-47.2A, "Mode 5 Containment Penetration Verification," was performed to verify that
containment isolation valves were restored to NSA; 1QS-4 was marked satisfactory in its NSA position.
In the evening of May 2, 2021, following verification that 1QS-4 was restored to NSA, 1OM-13.4.O was performed to fill
the train B loop seal and 1QS-4 was restrained open. Operations personnel concluded that the loop was not filled and
stopped performance of the procedure in order to perform other work. Therefore, with the procedure incomplete, the
decision was made by Operations supervision that check valve 1QS-4 be left restrained open in order to continue filling
the loop at a later time. There was no log entry made of this performance of 1OM-13.4.O per NOP-OP-1002, nor was an
entry made documenting the non-NSA position of 1QS-4.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE OF EVENT (Continued)
Following the attempt to fill the loop seal, Operations requested NDE to evaluate the level in the loop seals with NDE
confirming that both train A and B loop seals were satisfactory. Once determined that both loop seals were satisfactory,
due to conflicting priorities, the restoration steps that should have been performed in accordance with 1OM-13.4.O were
not performed.
On day shift May 3, 2021, the BVPS lead NDE inspector determined that the train B loop seal needed to be refilled, and
Operations attempted to refill this loop seal. At this point, the operating crew believed 1QS-4 to be in its NSA position.
Rather than restraining 1QS-4 open, they elected to open MOV-1QS-101B such that the RWST would provide enough
static head to open 1QS-4 and fill the loop seal. This was properly documented in the logs. The loop seal was later
determined by NDE to be satisfactory. Between the determination that the loops seals were satisfactory on May 2, 2021
and the final disposition of the train B loop seal, the working copy of the procedure which indicated the steps were not yet
complete for 1OM-13.4.O was misplaced. At this time, since the working procedure had been misplaced, the Operations
supervisor assumed that all steps had been completed and that 1QS-4 was therefore in its NSA position.
ANALYSIS OF EVENT
Since BVPS-1 entered Mode 4 and then Mode 3 with 1QS-4 inoperable, and without meeting the requirements of LCO
3.0.4, this is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for operation or condition prohibited by TS.
The risk impact of having the quench spray pump discharge check valve 1QS-4 in the open position when it is required to
be closed is negligible. The Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) only models 1QS-4 for its function to open and provide
quench spray flow following a Containment Isolation Phase B (CIB) signal, and this function was not impacted by the valve
being restrained open. The containment isolation function of 1QS-4 is not modeled in the PRA since the valve is required
to open and supply quench spray flow into containment in a severe accident. Additionally, the likelihood of an accident
generating CIB conditions while the plant remained in Modes 4 and 3 is very small, and if it were to occur the existing
recovery procedures include steps to close the outside containment isolation valve (MOV-1QS-101B) for this penetration
once quench spray flow is no longer required, to prevent any potential release through this line. Therefore, this event had
very low safety significance.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Completed Actions:
Operations removed the restraint and returned 1QS-4 to NSA on May 8, 2021.
Planned Actions:
Revise 1OM-13.4.O to direct that valves 1QS-3/1QS-4 are added to the containment penetration log when being
restrained open.
