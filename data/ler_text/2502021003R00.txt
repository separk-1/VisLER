On 10/9/2021 at 03:00, with Unit 3 in Mode 3 at 0% power, an actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system occurred when
level in the 3A Steam Generator increased to 80%, causing a Feedwater isolation signal, which tripped the running Steam
Generator Feedwater Pump. The AFW system automatically started in response to the trip of the last running feedwater pump.
All systems responded as designed to the 3A S/G high level condition. This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)
(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in the auto-start of the AFW system.

EVENT DESCRIPTION
On 10/9/21, while Unit 3 was in Mode 3 during a planned shutdown to commence the Cycle 32 refueling outage, with the
3B Steam Generator Feedwater Pump (SGFP) [SJ, P] in service, high level in the 3A Steam Generator (S/G) [SJ, SG]
caused a feedwater isolation signal that tripped the 3B SGFP. The AFW [BA] system automatically actuated as designed
in response to the trip of the last running SGFP.
Since Unit 3 was in Mode 3 and reactor subcritical, feedwater supply to the S/Gs was aligned through the bypass
feedwater flow control valves [SJ, FCV], with the 3B SGFP in operation. The 3A S/G main feedwater regulating valve
FCV-3-478 [SJ, FCV] and the upstream motor-operated isolation valve MOV-3-1407 [SJ, 20] were fully closed. The
bypass flow control valves were maintained in manual control as directed by the operating procedure. In response to a
gradually increasing level trend in the 3A S/G that was initially identified at approximately 02:40am, adjustments were
made to the 3A feedwater bypass flow control valve FCV-3-479 to reduce feedwater flow to the 3A S/G. By 02:50am, the
feedwater bypass flow control valve was fully closed and feedwater flow and 3A S/G level continued to increase. At
02:54am the feedwater bypass isolation valve POV-3-477 [SJ, ISV] was fully closed to ensure that 3A S/G feedwater flow
was positively secured through the bypass line. Feedwater flow and 3A S/G level continued to increase. At 02:56am level
in the 3A S/G reached 80% narrow range, initiating a feedwater isolation signal that tripped the 3B SGFP. AFW
automatically actuated in response to the trip of the last running SGFP.
All systems responded as designed to the elevated level condition in the 3A S/G. The AFW system was subsequently
secured and plant cooldown was continued in accordance with operating procedures.
CAUSE
The cause of the increasing level trend in the 3A S/G was seat leakage past the 3A S/G main feedwater regulating valve
FCV-3-478 and upstream isolation valve MOV-3-1407.
FCV-3-478 was overhauled. The plug, seat adapter, and seals were found degraded, consistent with extended service
wear. The normal overhaul PM frequency for the feedwater regulating valves is every 4 refueling outages; however, the
frequency for FCV-3-478 had been one-time extended to a 5th outage the previous cycle. The remaining feedwater
regulating valves have remained on a 4-outage overhaul PM frequency.
To support its primary function of feedwater isolation (no SGFP in operation), MOV-3-1407 closing torque is set up for
condensate pump discharge pressure, which yields a significantly lower differential pressure across the valve seat than
SGFP discharge pressure. This can result in the seating surface being less than fully sealed during normal Mode 3
operation when a SGFP is in service. Thus, seat leakage past MOV-3-1407 is expected given the deficiencies identified
with FCV-3-478.
SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE
This safety significance of this event was low. All systems and equipment operated as designed in response to high level
in the 3A S/G. Reactor Coolant System cooldown remained within procedural limits.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
1. FCV-3-478 was overhauled to correct the excessive seat leakage. PM frequency returned to every 4 outages.
2. Performed borescope inspection of MOV-3-1407 seating surfaces and verified no visible deficiencies.
3. Maintenance strategies and valve overhaul PM frequencies will be reviewed for adequacy.
4. A revision to the Operating Procedure was issued that provides guidance to Operations for closing the manual isolation
valves if excessive seat leakage becomes evident during plant startup and shutdown.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
EIIS Codes are shown in the format [IEEE system identifier, component function identifier, second component function
identifier (if appropriate)].
SIMILAR EVENTS
A review of automatic AFW start events over the previous 5 years was performed to identify similar events or patterns.
Although automatic AFW actuation normally occurs in Mode 3 after a trip from higher power levels due to S/G level shrink,
these events are not caused or influenced by valve seat leakage. No events were identified that involved an automatic
AFW actuation that was potentially caused by feedwater flow control valve seat leakage.
