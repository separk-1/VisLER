On 10/12/2023, Ginna Unit 1 experienced an uncomplicated manual reactor trip due to high Main Condenser back pressure and
a valid Auxiliary Feedwater actuation due to low Steam Generator level. At 2116, Operations received a high limit alarm for Air
Ejector Mass Flow Rate and observed condenser vacuum degrading and generator output beginning to lower. Field personnel
began bypassing the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control Valve to restore steam to the Air Ejectors. Concurrently with
actions in the field, the Main Control Room (MCR) Operators began a procedurally directed downpower. At 2127, the five-minute
restriction for turbine operation in the 'Back Pressure' region was exceeded and the MCR Unit Supervisor directed a reactor trip
as procedurally required.
Loss of supply air to the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control Valve was due to the Instrument Air (IA) Pressure Control
Valve (PCV) not providing adequate output pressure to keep the valve open. The IA PCV was replaced and tested satisfactory
prior to return to service.

I.P RE-EVENT PLANT CONDITIONS
At the time of the component failure, the plant was in MODE 1 at 100% rated thermal power.
II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
A. EVENT
On 10/12/2023 at 2127, Operations staff at Ginna Unit 1 initiated a manual reactor trip due to high Main Condenser back
pressure. The trip was uncomplicated and the operating crew stabilized the plant at the no-load reactor coolant
temperature.
The operating crew received a Plant Process Computer System (PPCS) high limit alarm for Air Ejector Mass Flow Rate at
2116. Operators concurrently observed condenser vacuum degrading and generator output beginning to lower. Loss of
Condenser Vacuum procedure was entered. The Field Supervisor and Principal Plant Operator (PPO) were dispatched to
investigate and found that the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control Air Operated Valve (AOV) was approximately 20%
open and closing and steam supply pressure to the Air Ejectors was abnormally low and lowering. Field personnel began
bypassing the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control AOV to restore steam to the Air Ejectors. At approximately 2125,
field personnel were successful in bypassing the valve and restoring Air Ejector operation. Concurrently with actions in
the field, the Main Control Room (MCR) Operators began a procedurally directed downpower. At 2125 the Main
Condenser back pressure began to lower, approximately 30 seconds after Air Ejector operation was restored. At 2127,
the five minute restriction for turbine operation in the 'Back Pressure' region was exceeded and the MCR Unit Supervisor
directed a reactor trip as required per the Loss of Condenser Vacuum procedure.
Loss of supply air to the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control valve was the result of the Instrument Air Pressure
Control Valve failing to provide adequate output pressure to maintain the valve in the open position. The Instrument Air
Pressure Control Valve was replaced and tested satisfactory prior to return to service.
B. INOPERABLE STRUCTURES, COMPONENTS, OR SYSTEMS CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT:
No other Systems, Structures, or Components (SSCs) were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the
event.

C. DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES OF MAJOR OCCURENCES:
2116 10/12/2023 PPCS Air Ejector Mass Flow Rate high limit alarm received
2121 10/12/2023 Loss of Condenser Vacuum entered
2125 10/12/2023 Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control Valve bypassed by field personnel
2127 10/12/2023 Manual Reactor Trip
D. OTHER SYSTEMS OR SECONDARY FUNCTIONS AFFECTED:
None
E. METHOD OF DISCOVERY:
Self-revealing: At 2116, MCR received PPCS Air Ejector Mass Flow Rate high limit alarm. Operators were dispatched to
the field and found that the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control AOV was approximately 20% open and closing and
steam supply pressure to the Air Ejectors was abnormally low and lowering.
F. SAFETY SYSTEM RESPONSES:
The manual reactor trip was not complex, and all systems responded normally post-trip. The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)
System actuated on low Steam Generator water level.
III. CAUSE OF EVENT:
A Root Cause Investigation performed by the station determined that the loss of supply air to the Main Air Ejector Steam
Pressure Control valve was the result of the Instrument Air Pressure Control Valve failing to provide adequate output
pressure to maintain the valve in the open position. A failure analysis concluded the supply air flow-path of the Instrument
Air Pressure Control Valve was obstructed due to poor manufacturing quality resulting in lowered output pressure.
Organizational factors were also investigated and the team identified improvement opportunities during the stations
implementation of the Single Point Vulnerability (SPV) project in diverse stakeholder engagement and use of risk-
elimination bias.
IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE SAFETY CONSEQUENCES OF THE EVENT:
Per UFSAR 15.0.8.2, this reactor trip falls under Condition II - Faults of Moderate Frequency. The plant was capable of
being returned to operation after corrective action. As there was no loss of any barrier to the escape of radioactive
products, there was no release of radioactive materials in effluents to unrestricted areas (in conformance with 10 CFR 20,
Standards for Protection Against Radiation). The event did not propagate to a more serious incident of the Condition III or
Condition IV type.

V. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The Instrument Air Pressure Control Valve was replaced and tested satisfactory prior to return to service.
Long-term corrective actions include:
1. Dresser Masoneilan Model 77-20 regulators installed in single point vulnerability (SPV) locations will be replaced to
prevent SCRAM recurrence.
2. Creation of independent, cross-functional SPV Challenge team to challenge all existing mitigation and elimination
strategies.
3. Conduct a Leadership Training Case Study for Operations, Maintenance, and Engineering focusing on the contributing
causes of this event. The training includes all Front Line Supervisors (FLS), Mid Level Managers (MLMs) and Senior
Leadership Team (SLT) personnel.
4. Upgrade Air Ejector Steam Control AOV from Low Risk SPV to Medium Risk SPV and implement and elimination
strategy.
