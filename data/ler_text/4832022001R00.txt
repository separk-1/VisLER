16. Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines)
With the plant at full power on January 7, 2022, an undetected relay failure caused the solid-state reactor protection system
(SSPS) to actuate during restoration from a Reactor Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test, thus resulting
in an unplanned reactor trip.
The reactor trip was reported per Event Notification 55698 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and
50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A).
The cause of the reactor trip was that procedure OSP-SB-0001B, "Reactor Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device
Operational Test," did not include adequate instructions for verifying the absence of a "B" train General Warning trip signal
prior to operating the "A" train Multiplexer Test Switch during test restoration. This was due to inadequate guidance for
development of the procedure.
Corrective Actions include revising Operations surveillance procedures to include verification of green and amber test lights
at panel SB032B during restoration and revising Operations and l&C surveillance procedures to include verification that
contacts for relays that have actuated during the test have changed back to their normal state, prior to test restoration.
Additional corrective actions include revising the procedure preparation process, improving the screening and incorporation
of Operating Experience, improving lesson plans, conducting training, placing operator aids adjacent to the Multiplexer Test
Switch, and requiring an inspection on other master relays.

NARRATIVE
1. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S):
The systems and components affected by this event include the reactor protection system (RPS) and the solid-state protection
system (SSPS).
The RPS at Callaway Plant initiates a unit shutdown, based on the values of selected unit parameters, to protect against violating
the core fuel design limits and reactor coolant system pressure boundary design limits during anticipated operational occurrences
and to assist the Engineered Safety Features systems in mitigating accidents.
2. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS:
Callaway was in MODE 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power at the time of this event. No major safety related systems
were out of service.
3. EVENT DESCRIPTION:
On January 7, 2022 at 1223 with the reactor at approximately 100% rated thermal power, the reactor automatically tripped as a
result of a set of contacts internal to SSPS 'B' train Master Relay SB032CK524 that failed to close. Safety systems functioned as
expected. The Operations staff responded to the event in accordance with applicable plant procedures. An ENS notification (EN#
55698) was made for this event at 1629 hours on January 7, 2022.
Prior to the reactor trip, Operations and Instrumentation and Control (I&C) personnel coordinated the performance of ISF-SB-00A32,
"SSPS Tm B Functional Test," and OSP-SB-0001B, "Reactor Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test," to perform
regularly scheduled Technical Specification surveillances on the "B" Train Solid State Protection System and "B" Train Reactor Trip
Breaker. All steps in both procedures were performed as written, with MC completing ISF-SB-00A32 as briefed prior to the
performance of Section 6.4 of OSP-SB-0001B.
With AC testing completed, Operations proceeded with the performance of Section 6.4 for the Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating
Device Operational Test (TADOT), which closes Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker "B" in order to conduct testing that opens
Reactor Trip Breaker "B". By design, closing Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker "B" creates a General Warning signal which has
the potential to trip the reactor if a second General Warning signal is received. After testing was completed and during the
restoration of Section 6.4, once Reactor Trip Breaker "B" was closed, Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker "B" was opened.
In accordance with OSP-SB-0001B, Operations verified that Annunciator 76A, "SSPS B GENERAL WARNING," was clear
and that the General Warning red light on panel SB029B for SSPS Train 'B' was off. These indications led Operators to
believe that the General Warning signal was no longer present, and consequently, the Operators proceeded on with Step
6.4.45 to return the multiplexer test switch through "Inhibit" to the "A+B" position at SB029B. Moving the multiplexer test
switch through "Inhibit" is known to generate a second General Warning signal, but this is required to restore SSPS to the
normal configuration. When Operations performed Step 6.4.45 to place the multiplexer test switch through "Inhibit" at
SB029B, a reactor trip occurred unexpectedly.
Per plant design, an auxiliary feedwater system actuation occurred as expected in response to the reactor trip. Also, consistent with
plant response to a reactor trip from a high power level, a main feedwater isolation signal was generated.
Following the reactor trip, an erratic position indication was observed for one feedwater isolation valve, but the valve was
subsequently confirmed to be closed. In addition, one intermediate range nuclear instrumentation channel failed. Other nuclear
instrumentation channels functioned correctly to indicate the shutdown state of the reactor. These failures did not complicate the

Operators' response to the event.
After the immediate actions of procedure E-0, "Reactor Trip or Safety Injection," were performed, and once the plant was
stabilized, Operations contacted I&C to investigate the cause of the failure. l&C discovered that the green test light was
de-energized on panel SB032B. After reviewing the appropriate electrical drawings, failure of the 6-10 contacts for relay
SB032CK524 was identified as a potential cause. With permission from Operations, relay SB032CK524 was mechanically
agitated. This caused the green test light on SB032B to illuminate, indicating that the 6-10 contacts had previously not
properly closed.
4.(cid:9) ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES:
There were no actual nuclear, radiological, or personnel safety impacts associated with this event. The potential impact
was on nuclear safety with respect to challenging the reactor trip system as well as any potential challenges to the plant due
to the transient associated with a reactor trip. However, the reactor automatically tripped (i.e., shut down) per design, and
all safety systems functioned as designed with the minor exceptions as described above in the Event Description section.
5.(cid:9) REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
This LER is submitted pursuant to 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) to report a reactor protection system actuation during surveillance
testing, as well as an auxiliary feedwater actuation. Specifically, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) states in part, "The licensee
shall report:
(A) Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of
this section...
(B) The systems to which the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section are:
(1)(cid:9) Reactor protection system (RPS) including: reactor scram or reactor trip....
(6) PWR auxiliary or emergency feedwater system.
The Callaway plant RPS was actuated on January 7, 2022 at 1223. This fulfills the reporting requirement of 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) by actuation of the system specified in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1).
A valid auxiliary feedwater system actuation was initiated after the reactor trip. This fulfills the reporting requirement of 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) by actuation of the system specified in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6).
6.(cid:9) CAUSE OF THE EVENT:
The cause of the reactor trip was that procedure OSP-SB-0001B, "Reactor Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test,"
did not include adequate instructions for verifying the absence of a "B" train General Warning trip signal prior to operating the "A"
train multiplexer test switch during test restoration. This was due to inadequate guidance for development of the procedure.
