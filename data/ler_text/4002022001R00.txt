On January 10, 2022, a Reactor Auxiliary Building operator for the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, noted that the 'A'
Train Essential Services Chilled Water System chiller’s compressor pre-rotation vane (PRV) was mispositioned. This resulted in
the chiller being declared inoperable at 07:57 on January 10th. Maintenance personnel identified that the PRV control arm had
slipped at its tapered connection to the associated control shaft due to reduced torque on the cap screw holding it in place. The
chiller was declared operable on January 11th at 21:09, following successful completion of corrective maintenance.
The cause of the slippage was inadequate guidance within maintenance procedure CM-M0259, "Essential Chiller Compressor
Maintenance," which presented a latent error trap for installation of the cap screw over an adjacent cam plate. This resulted in
torque loss on the fastener while the chiller was in operation. The cap screw was previously installed during a maintenance
activity involving a replacement of the compressor and the PRV actuator in August 2021. To address this condition, the cap
screw was retorqued to proper specification and the adjacent cam plate was validated to no longer interfere with the cap screw.
CM-M0259 was revised to provide guidance for proper cap screw installation.

A. Background
On January 10, 2022, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP) in Mode 1 and at 100% power, a Reactor
Auxiliary Building (RAB) [NF] operator noted that the 'A' Train Essential Services Chilled Water (ESCW) [KM] chiller’s
[CHU] compressor pre-rotation vane (PRV) [CMP] control arm [DRIV] was mispositioned while the unit was shutdown. No
other systems, structures, or components were inoperable at the time that contributed to the event.
The ESCW System circulates chilled water to the safety related cooling coils [CCL] of the air handling units [AHU] serving
their respective heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for transfer of the thermal loads generated in the
various areas of the plant to the Service Water System [BI]. Areas include the control room [VI], RAB electrical equipment
protection rooms [VF], RAB switchgear rooms [VF], and other engineering safety feature (ESF) [JE] equipment areas [VF].
There is firm evidence that the 'A' Train of the ESCW System became inoperable while operating between December 27,
2021 at about 02:00 Eastern Standard Time (EST) through January 11, 2022, at 21:09 EST, for a total duration of
approximately 15 days and 19 hours, which includes time that the 'A' Train ESCW System chiller was shutdown for
planned operational activities. HNP Technical Specifications for the ESCW System list an allowed out-of-service time of 7
days for conditions impacting a single train. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as “any
operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant’s Technical Specifications.”
Further, there were several instances were either the 'B' Train chiller or other associated ‘B’ Train equipment were briefly
inoperable for periods between December 27, 2021 through January 11, 2022 due to planned maintenance or testing.
During those periods, operations staff were present with approved procedures capable of restoring the system to service
prior to negatively impacting ESF equipment. These events are reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)
for "Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are
needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.”
B. Event Description
On January 10, 2022, a RAB operator noted that the 'A' Train chiller’s compressor PRV control arm was mispositioned
while the 'A' Train chiller was shutdown. Maintenance personnel identified that the PRV control arm had slipped at its
tapered connection to the associated control shaft [DRIV] due to reduced torque on the cap screw [DRIV] holding it in
place. Investigation into the event identified that the PRV control arm had slipped when the 'A' Train chiller was started on
December 27, 2021. The chiller continued to run normally, however the slippage resulted in reduced available chiller
cooling capacity to respond to a design basis event. Further, the chiller would have been unable to restart if it tripped,
which is an expected occurrence when responding to certain design basis events. The chiller was declared inoperable at
07:57 on January 10th when the deficient condition was identified. The chiller was declared operable on January 11th at
21:09 following successful completion of corrective maintenance and testing.
C. Causal Factors
Maintenance personnel identified that the PRV control arm had slipped at its tapered connection to the associated control
shaft due to reduced torque on the cap screw holding it in place. The cause of the slippage was inadequate guidance
within maintenance procedure CM-M0259, "Essential Chiller Compressor Maintenance," which presented a latent error

trap for installation of the cap screw over an adjacent cam plate, versus through the designed bore hole. This resulted in
torque loss on the fastener over time while the chiller was in operation. The cap screw was previously installed during a
maintenance activity involving a replacement of the compressor and the PRV actuator in August 2021.
D. Corrective Actions
The cap screw was retorqued to proper specification and the adjacent cam plate was validated to no longer interfere with
the cap screw. Visual inspection of the 'B' Train chiller validated proper fastener assembly without cam plate interference.
CM-M0259 was revised to provide guidance for the PRV control arm installation at the adjacent cam plate interface. A
'caution' statement was added to ensure the cam plate is not under the shoulder of the joining cap screw.
E. Safety Analysis
The ‘A’ Train ESCW chiller was in operation during the period in question with normal chilled water outlet temperature.
Thus, the supported ‘A’ Train locations would have been supplied with chilled water at the onset of the event. Although
cooling to the 'A' Charging/Safety Injection Pump (CSIP) [P] [BQ] room would eventually be challenged, evaluation has
shown that a loss of room cooling will have no adverse impact to CSIP function in the first 120 minutes. Proceduralized
actions are contained within AOP-026, "Loss of Essential Services Chilled Water System," for operators to move a
portable fan [AHU] into the associated CSIP room door to ensure adequate cooling is maintained. These actions are
determined to occur within 50 minutes (40 minutes for recognition, 10 minutes for implementation) from the time of an ESF
start signal being generated for a CSIP, and prior to room heat-up becoming a challenge. These actions are evaluated
and approved by HNP License Amendment 153 and are bounding for both normal and emergent response scenarios for
loss of the ESCW System. During the period in question, there were several instances where the 'B' Train chiller or other
associated ‘B’ Train equipment were inoperable to support testing or maintenance. For these cases, proceduralized steps
for system restoration existed and operators were present to perform them. EOP-E-0, "Reactor Trip or Safety Injection,"
includes a verification per Attachment 3, "Safeguards Actuation Verification," that the ESCW System is in operation with
both chillers and directs entry into AOP-026 for loss of any chiller. AOP-026 directs operations to manually start the
chillers per OP-148, "Essential Service Chilled Water System." Start of the 'B' Train chiller and chilled water pump would
have been successful, with recovery time being well under 120 minutes. Based on this information, the safety function of
the ESCW system was maintained even while the system was inoperable.
NEI 99-02, Revision 7, "Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guidelines," states the following for inclusion of
events on the NRC Mitigating Systems Performance Indicator for Safety System Function Failures (SSFF), "The level of
judgment for reporting an event or condition under paragraph (a)(2)(v) as an SSFF is a reasonable expectation of
preventing the fulfillment of a safety function." Based on this guidance and the above analysis showing the safety function
can be reasonably expected to be met within the required period, this event will not be counted as a SSFF.
Subsequent to the condition discovered on January 10, 2022, the ESCW System compressor, PRVs, actuator, and
linkages were re-categorized as RISC-3 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.69. All ESCW System functions associated with
the compressor, refrigerant, and chilled water supply are considered to be low safety significant. Therefore, a similar
condition discovered in the future would not need to be reported under the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73 in accordance
with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.69(g).
