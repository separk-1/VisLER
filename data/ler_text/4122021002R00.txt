At 0632 on October 5, 2021, Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit 2 (BVPS-2) automatically tripped due to a loss of the Reactor
Trip System Interlock for Power Range Neutron Flux (P-10) and associated power range trip block signals. BVPS-2 was at
approximately 90% power and in an end of cycle coast down. The Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically started as
designed. The apparent cause was a premature failure of a Train A Solid State Protection System (SSPS) universal logic board
(ULB) due to manufacturing defects with the solder joints which may have resulted in an intermittent loss of connection.
This is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection
System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1) and an automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)
(iv)(B)(6). Corrective actions include replacement of the ULB, vendor testing of several ULBs within the SSPS, review of the final
vendor test report for additional actions, and establishment of maintenance plans for periodic testing of the SSPS ULBs at both
units.

NARRATIVE
NARRATIVE
Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX].
BACKGROUND
The Solid State Protection System (SSPS) [JG] takes binary inputs (voltage/no voltage) from the process and nuclear
instrument channels corresponding to conditions (normal/abnormal) of BVPS-2 parameters. The SSPS performs the
decision logic for actuating a reactor trip or ESF actuation, generates the electrical output signal that will initiate the
required trip or actuation, and provides the status, permissive, and annunciator output signals to the main control room of
the unit.
DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
At 0632 on October 5, 2021, BVPS-2 automatically tripped with an initial annunciator indication of a Power Range Low
Setpoint Neutron Flux High Reactor Trip. BVPS-2 was at approximately 90% power and in an end of cycle coast down. No
equipment was inoperable at the start of the event that would have contributed to the event. The Auxiliary Feedwater
System [BA] automatically started as designed. The trip was not complicated and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3.
The trip was caused by an intermittent internal failure of the SSPS, specifically the loss of the reactor trip system interlock
for power range neutron flux (P-10) and associated power range trip block signals. Troubleshooting was performed and
three universal logic boards (ULBs) were replaced. Following the replacement, the SSPS was returned to service and
BVPS-2 was put back online on October 8, 2021. The replaced ULBs along with several additional extent of condition
ULBs from within both trains of the SSPS system were sent to Westinghouse for Westinghouse Automated Board Test
System (WABTS) testing. The testing identified deficiencies in some of the ULBs.
CAUSE OF EVENT
Based on review of the Sequence of Events Log, the trip was generated within the Train A SSPS due to a loss of the
reactor trip system interlock for power range neutron flux (P-10) and associated power range trip block signals. The direct
cause of the trip was determined to be an internal failure of the A403 SSPS ULB. The apparent cause was a premature
failure of the Train A SSPS ULB due to manufacturing defects with the solder joints which may have resulted in an
intermittent loss of connection.

NARRATIVE
ANALYSIS OF EVENT
This is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in automatic actuation of the Reactor
Protection System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1) and an automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System per 10
CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6).
The plant risk associated with the BVPS-2 reactor trip on October 5, 2021, is considered to be very low. This is based on
the change in average core damage frequency derived using the conditional core damage probability and change in
average large early release frequency derived using conditional large early release probability for the event.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Completed Actions:
The 3 suspect SSPS ULBs were replaced and sent for WABTS testing.
An additional 15 ULBs from both trains of SSPS were replaced and sent for WABTS testing as extent of condition.
Planned Actions:
The final Westinghouse WABTS test reports will be evaluated for additional actions that may be necessary based on the
reportโs findings.
Periodic WABTS testing maintenance plans for both units will be established at an appropriate frequency.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
A review of the previous three years did not identify similar events that have occurred at BVPS.
