On 3/1/21 at 11:08 hours, Turkey Point Unit 3 experienced an unplanned reactor trip from 100% power. Restoration from a
routine test of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) was in progress when the reactor trip occurred. As expected for the
conditions, the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically initiated in response to the reactor trip to maintain Steam
Generator levels in normal bands. All equipment required for the immediate reactor trip response functioned normally.
A malfunction of the B-train Reactor Trip Breaker cubicle cell switch during the RPS test restoration caused the reactor trip. The
breaker and cell switch have since been replaced and Unit 3 returned to normal power operation.
This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for initiation of the Reactor Protection [10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)
(1)] and Auxiliary Feedwater [10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6)] systems.

EVENT DESCRIPTION
On 3/1/21 at 11:08 hours, Turkey Point Unit 3 experienced an unplanned reactor trip from 100% power. Restoration from
a regularly scheduled test of the RPS was in progress when the reactor trip occurred. In response to the reactor trip, the
AFW system [BA] automatically initiated to maintain Steam Generator [SG] levels stable within normal post-trip bands,
which is expected following a reactor trip from a higher power level.
Restoration steps in the 3B Reactor Protection System Logic Test (procedure 3-SMI-049.02B), were being followed at the
time of the reactor trip. The test is scheduled every quarter to meet the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements
of TS 4.3.1, Table 4.3-1, Functional Unit 20. The surveillance procedure aligns the RPS in a train-specific test
configuration that utilizes the A-Train or B-Train Reactor Trip Bypass Breaker (BYA or BYB) [AA, BKR] and checks that
the normal Reactor Trip Beaker (RTA or RTB) [AA, BKR] actuates in response to several trip logic inputs. During
restoration of the B-Train test, with the RTB closed, the reactor trip occurred when the BYB was tripped open for
restoration.
All equipment required for the immediate reactor trip response functioned properly. However, CV-3-2830, 3D Steam Dump
to Condenser (SDTC) [SB, V], was slow to respond after the valve was demanded closed. This increased the Reactor
Coolant System (RCS) cooldown rate, lowering Pressurizer level and automatically isolating RCS letdown. The Reactor
Operator took manual control of the Pressurizer level function and restored letdown as directed by procedure. SDTC
position and Pressurizer level are not referenced during Immediate Operator Actions (IOAs) and did not complicate the
response to the reactor trip.
Corrective actions were taken to resolve the deficiencies associated with the RTB and CV-3-2830 prior to returning Unit 3
to service.
CAUSE
Reactor Trip and Bypass breaker cubicle cell switches provide logic inputs to the turbine trip primary and backup relays.
The SOE report revealed that the reactor trip signal was initiated by turbine trip logic. The most likely cause identified by
the Engineering team was that following the RPS surveillance, with the RTB racked in, a RTB cell switch was incorrectly
providing racked-out position logic input to the backup turbine trip relay. When the BYB was tripped open during
restoration, the logic to actuate the backup turbine trip relay was completed, tripping the turbine and initiating Train-A and
Train-B reactor trip signals.
The Westinghouse DB-50 Reactor Trip and Bypass breakers utilize cell switch contacts located inside the breaker
cubicles that provide open position logic to the turbine trip relays if the breaker is racked out. Failure analysis performed
jointly between FPL Engineering and Westinghouse revealed that the most likely cause of the incorrect RTB position logic
was failure of the cell switch contact. Graphite grease used for lubrication was found accumulated and hardened, creating
an electrical tracking path for the incorrect logic signal. A review of the FPL preventive maintenance procedure showed
that steps to clean and reapply grease on the switch contacts is condition-based rather than prescriptive.
The sluggish performance of CV-3-2830 was caused by an instrument air leak from its modulating solenoid, SV-3-1440
[SB, SSV].

SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE
The safety significance of this event is low. All equipment required for immediate response to the automatic reactor trip
functioned as designed. One SDTC valve was slow to close, causing automatic isolation letdown and prompting the
Reactor Operator to take manual control of pressurizer level. This equipment condition did not complicate the response or
lessen the margin of safety that was maintained throughout the event.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
- The Unit 3 RTB was replaced.
- The Unit 3 RTB cell switches were replaced.
- The Unit 3 RTA, BYA, and BYB breaker cubicles and cell switches were inspected, cleaned, and tested for proper
operation.
- A modification to detect for a standing trip signal from cell switch contacts was installed on Unit 3 RTA, RTB, BYA, and
BYB.
- Work orders for Unit 4 RTA, RTB, BYA, and BYB cell switch inspection will be originated and scheduled for next Unit 4
outage.
- A modification to detect for a standing trip signal from cell switch contacts for Unit 4 RTA, RTB, BYA, and BYB will be
developed and scheduled for implementation during the next Unit 4 refueling outage.
- A revision will be submitted to procedure 0-PME-049.01, Reactor Trip and Bypass Breaker Inspection and Maintenance,
to require cleaning and lubrication of cell switch contacts.
- SV-3-1440, modulating solenoid for CV-3-2830, was replaced.
- AR 2385529 will prescribe additional actions to address the contributing causes and condition extent.
