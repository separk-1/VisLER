On June 22, 2021, Donald C. Cook Unit 2, was operating at 100 percent power. At approximately 2305 hours, equipment
operators reported a steam leak in a crossover pipe at the Right Moisture Separator Reheater (MSR) joint that was unisolable.
Operators manually tripped the reactor at 2331 hours.(cid:9) All safety systems and Engineered Safety Features equipment
operated as expected.
Prior to the reactor trip, operators closed the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) 'B' Left Reheat Steam Intercept Valve at 1040
hours, due to an electro-hydraulic control (EHC) fluid leak from the valve's hydraulic actuator.(cid:9) Following closure of the
intercept valve, the EHC fluid leak from the hydraulic actuator was manually isolated. No abnormal system conditions were
noted following closure of the valve. This valve closure is an abnormal system alignment.
A failure investigation determined that the steam leak occurred at a right MSR crossover piping expansion joint. The expansion
joint protective liner was displaced downstream due to a failed weld that exposed the bellows to direct steam flow.
The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid actuation of the
Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the manual reactor trip.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On June 22, 2021, Donald C. Cook (CNP) Unit 2, was operating at 100 percent power. At approximately 2305
hours, excessive steam noise was noted on the Unit 2 Turbine Building [NM] 633' elevation. Equipment operators
were dispatched to investigate and reported a steam leak in a crossover pipe at 2-OME-80R, Right Moisture
Separator Reheater (MSR) [SB][MSR] that was unisolable. Operators manually tripped the reactor [RCT] at 2331
hours. All safety systems and Engineered Safety Features equipment operated as expected.
Prior to the reactor trip, operators closed 2-OME-93-BL, Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) 'B' Left Reheat Steam
Intercept Valve [S13][V] at 1040 hours, due to an electro-hydraulic control (EHC) fluid leak from the valve's hydraulic
actuator. Following closure of the intercept valve, the EHC fluid leak from the hydraulic actuator was manually
isolated. No abnormal system conditions were noted following closure of 2-OME-93-BL and isolation of EHC
supply to the hydraulic actuator. This valve closure is an abnormal system alignment.
Event Notification 55322 was submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), Reactor Protection System
(RPS) [JG] actuation as a four (4) hour non-emergency report, and under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), specified
system actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA], as an eight (8) hour non-emergency report.
A failure investigation was conducted following the reactor trip and determined that the steam leak occurred at
2-XJ-113-5, Right MSR OME-80R Reheat Steam to LPT 'B' Expansion Joint [SB][EXJ]. Upon disassembly, a
circumferential weld attaching the liner which protects the convolutions (or bellows) from direct steam flow had
failed. The failed weld allowed the liner to displace downstream which exposed the bellows to direct steam flow.
The direct exposure of steam flow to the bellows resulted in increased local turbulence and vibration, leading to
high cycle fatigue of the bellows, and the eventual steam leak.
During the failure investigation and extent of condition evaluation, the design of the expansion joint liner was
reviewed. A design change was implemented to increase the thickness of the inner liner from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch.
Additionally, a thicker weld was specified to attach the liner to the replacement expansion joint. The LPT 'A' Left,
'B' Right, and 'C' Left expansion joints were replaced that included the liners and welds with the revised
specifications.
Following completion of repairs, Unit 2 was returned to service when the main generator [TB][GEN] was
synchronized to the electrical grid at 2328 hours on July 8, 2021.
The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid actuation
of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the manual reactor
trip.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE OF THE EVENT
A circumferential weld attaching the liner which protects the bellows from direct steam flow within the expansion
joint had failed, allowing the liner to displace downstream and subject the bellows to direct steam flow. The direct
exposure of steam flow to the bellows resulted in increased local turbulence and vibration, leading to high cycle
fatigue of the bellows. The resultant steam leak was unisolable which required a manual reactor trip.
A causal evaluation is ongoing at the time of this report. A supplement to this LER will be provided if the results
of the evaluation significantly change the perception of the course, significance, implications, or consequences of
the event or if it results in substantial changes in corrective actions planned.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Prompt Corrective Actions
A design change was completed that increased the thickness of the inner liner from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch, and
specified a thicker weld to attach the liner to the replacement expansion joint.
The LPT 'A' Left, 'B' Right, and 'C' Left expansion joints were replaced that included the liners and welds with the
revised specifications contained within the design change.
Plant procedures 1-0HP-5030-050-001 and 2-OHP-5030-050-006, Main Turbine and Feed Pump Turbine Valve
Functional Checks, were placed on hold until new guidance is provided to revise the procedures for valve closure
at power to preclude any potential impacts to the system.
Planned Corrective Actions
Revise plant procedures 1-0HP-5030-050-001 and 2-OHP-5030-050-006, Main Turbine and Feed Pump Turbine
Valve Functional Checks.

NARRATIVE
Potential industrial hazards from the unisolable steam leak were recognized and mitigated by evacuating the
Turbine Building 633' elevation to protect personnel and by tripping the reactor.
RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY
There was no actual or potential radiological safety hazard resulting from the unisolable steam leak and manual
reactor trip
PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT (PRA)
A PRA review of the manual reactor trip was performed to characterize the safety significance of the event. This
review was performed by adjusting the CNP Internal Events PRA model to reflect the plant configuration at the
time, and then using the model to calculate the estimated Conditional Core Damage Probability (CCDP) and
Conditional Large Early Release Probability (CLERP). A comparison of the CCDP and CLERP estimates to
regulatory guidance resulted in the conclusion that this event had very low safety significance.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
Licensee Event Report 316\2016-001-01, Manual Reactor Trip Due To Moisture Separator Heater Expansion
Joint Failure.
The Root Cause was determined to be an organizational failure to recognize the risk significance of, and to
adequately correct or mitigate, previously identified vibration issues with the Unit 2 `B' right MSR crossover
expansion joint tie rod and bellows in a timely fashion. Contributing causes included tack welds that were
inappropriately applied to nuts on the tie rod areas under tensile load.
