At 18:19 on May 27, 2023, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Unit 2 operating at approximately 100% power and
steady-state operation, Unit 2 Generator Transformer (2GT/XFMR) lockout occurred causing the turbine and subsequently
reactor to trip. Operators responded to the event in accordance with approved procedures and safely placed the plant in Mode 3.
The direct cause of this event was the failure of the A-phase lightning arrester on 2GT/XFMR. The failed arrester was sent out for
a failure analysis to be performed by a third-party laboratory.
May 27, 2023 at 19:20 Event Notification (EN) # 56543 was reported to the NRC as a 4-hour notification under 10 CFR 50.72(b)
(2)(iv)(B) actuation of the reactor protection system and a Notification of Unusual Event. On May 28, 2023 at 00:45, updated EN
# 56543 reported to the NRC for 8-Hr Non-Emergency report IAW 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for an AFW Actuation.
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a Reactor Trip and a valid Pressurized Water Reactor Auxiliary
Feedwater actuation signal.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
At 18:19 on May 27, 2023, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) Unit 2 operating at approximately 100%
power and steady-state operation, Unit 2 Main Transformer (2GT/XFMR) [XFMR] lockout occurred causing the main
turbine [TA] and subsequently reactor to trip and the actuation of auxiliary feedwater (AFW) [BA]. A Notification of Unusual
Event was declared based on multiple fire alarms in the containment building that were not verified within 15 minutes. At
18:45, there was verification of no fire in the containment building. Termination of the Notification of Unusual Event
occurred at 23:04.
This event was reported to the NRC on May 27, 2023 at 19:20 in Event Notification (EN) number 56543, as a 4-hour
notification under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) actuation of the reactor protection system. On May 28, 2023 at 00:45,
updated EN# 56543 reported to the NRC for 8 Hr Non-Emergency report IAW 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for an AFW
Actuation.
An outplant operator was in the vicinity of the 2GT/XFMR at the time of the trip and noted a loud noise and smoke from
the transformer. Visual inspection of A-phase lightning arrester [LAR] showed evidence of arcing present between the top
and bottom stack. This was corroborated by security camera footage revealing a bright flash and ensuing smoke
emanating from a 2GT/XFMR lightning arrester.
Troubleshooting determined the most likely cause of the 2GT/XFMR lockout to be failure of the A-phase lightning arrester.
The failed lightning arrester shorted to ground causing a correct actuation of protective relaying, specifically instantaneous
overcurrent and short to ground that led to the lockout of the 2GT/XFMR transformer.
This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a reactor trip and an AFW actuation signal.
Unit 1 was not affected during this event and remained at 100% power.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
Nuclear: Operations actions were taken as a part of the event response procedures and successfully restored power to all
non-safeguard buses at 19:25 on May 27, 2023. Steam generator level was maintained throughout the event using the
AFW system.
Radiological: No additional Radiological Risk.
Industrial: No additional Industrial Risk.
Environmental: No additional Environmental Risk.
The health and safety of the public and site personnel were not impacted during this event.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The direct cause of 2GT/XFMR lockout and Unit 2 Reactor Trip was the failure of A-Phase lightning arrester on the 2GT/
XFMR.
The cause of the A-Phase lightning arrester failure on 2GT/XFMR was that transformer maintenance procedures did not
effectively implement the maintenance strategy for the transformer lightning arresters.
It was determined that all of the probable failure modes would be in line with the degraded watts loss testing results
obtained and therefore should have been identified as part of the program trending and inspections under the transformer
maintenance procedure.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
On June 1, 2023, work was completed to replace all three lightning arresters on 2GT/XFMR.
Various inspections were performed to ensure no equipment proximal to the A-phase arrester was damaged when it
failed. This includes thermographic inspections, doble testing of GT high and low bushings, transformer windings, and
lightning arresters, Gas-in-oil sampling of the 2GT/XFMR and visual inspection of the transmission lines feeding the
transformer.
On June 2, 2023 at 02:25, Unit 2 entered Mode 1 and was placed online.
On June 22, 2023, the failed arrester was sent out for failure analysis to be performed by a third-party laboratory.
Changes to transformer maintenance procedures are being implemented to clarify and enhance the testing and review
requirements for the lightning arresters and are documented in the corrective action program.
