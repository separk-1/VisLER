On April 23, 2022, at 0224 hours, with Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, two control rods
partially dropped during control rod testing resulting in misalignment, which required a manual reactor
trip in accordance with plant procedure. All control rods fully inserted into the core following the
manual reactor trip. All safety systems functioned as expected. The Auxiliary Feedwater system
actuated as designed to provide makeup flow to the steam generators. This event did not impact
public health and safety.
The cause of the event was an intermittent high resistance connection in the rod control system
moveable regulation circuitry resulting from insulation inappropriately inserted into a crimped lug
connection. The connection was made during initial plant construction and degraded over time.
This event was reported to the NRC as a four-hour, non-emergency Event Notification Number 55856 on
April 23, 2022 per 10 CFR 50.72(b)2(iv)(B), Actuation of the Reactor Protection System and an eight-
hour non-emergency notification under the same Event Notification per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A),
Specified Safety System Actuation.

NARRATIVE
BACKGROUND
The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this
LER. Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are enclosed
within brackets. Catawba unique system and component identifiers are contained within
parentheses.
This event is being reported under the following criterion:
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), for any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation
of the reactor protection system and the PWR auxiliary feedwater system.
Rod Control System [JD](IRE):
The IRE system provides for reactor power modulation by manual or automatic control of full length
control rod banks in a pre-selected sequence and for manual operation of individual banks. Alarms
are provided to alert the operator in the event of a control rod deviation exceeding a preset limit.
Reactor Protection System [JC](IPE):
The Reactor Trip System automatically limits reactor operation to within a safe region by shutting
down the reactor whenever the limits of the region are approached. The safe operating region is
defined by several considerations such as mechanical/hydraulic limitations on equipment and heat
transfer phenomena. Therefore, the Reactor Trip System keeps surveillance on process variables
which are directly related to equipment mechanical limitations, such as pressure, pressurizer water
level, and on variables which directly affect the heat transfer capability of the reactor. Other
parameters utilized in the IPE system are calculated from various process variables. Whenever a
direct process or calculated variable exceeds a setpoint, the reactor will be shut down in order to
protect against either gross damage to fuel cladding or loss of system integrity, which could lead to
release of radioactive fission products into the Containment.
The various reactor trip circuits automatically open the reactor trip breakers whenever a condition
monitored by the IPE system reaches a preset level. Station operators may elect to actuate the
reactor trip switchgear manually (manual reactor trip) using either of two control board switches.
The manual trip consists of two switches, one for train A and one for train B, in the control room.
Operating a manual trip switch removes the voltage from the corresponding undervoltage trip coil
and energizes the shunt coil while actuating the associated Reactor Trip Breaker.

Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA](CA):
The CA System provides an emergency feedwater supply to the Steam Generators [SG](SG) in the
event of a loss of the respective Unit's Feedwater System [SJ](CF) to remove energy stored in the
core and primary coolant. This ensures the capability to transfer fission product decay heat and
other residual heat loads from the Reactor Coolant System [A13](NC) during both normal operation
and accident conditions. Three CA pumps are provided, powered from separate and diverse power
sources. Two motor driven pumps are powered from two separate trains of emergency on-site
power, each supplying feedwater to two steam generators. One turbine driven pump, supplying
feedwater to all four steam generators is driven by steam from either the B or C steam generators.
These pumps will automatically start upon receipt of a signal satisfying the logic for automatic start of
the respective pump, or each pump can be manually started from the control
room.
EVENT DESCRIPTION
At approximately 0224 on April 23, 2022, Operations was performing the quarterly rod control
movement test. The first bank to be tested was Control bank D (CBD). Operators selected CBD
and began moving rods inward. Rods correctly inserted a few steps and then CBD Group 1 began
dropping into the core. Operations noted the dropping rods and released the in-hold-out switch which
stopped demand for rod motion. The rods from CBD Group 1 were subsequently caught at heights near
the bottom of the core. Operations verified through alternate indications that two rods had partially
dropped and then manually tripped the reactor per plant procedures.
Catawba is designed to isolate feedwater during all reactor scrams and start auxiliary feedwater to
provide core cooling until it is determined that main feedwater will be aligned. In the case of the
Unit 2 scram on April 23, 2022, it was not desired to restore main feedwater via a normal timeline to
preserve rod control failure evidence. There were no complications cooling the core with auxiliary
feedwater during this time. When operations restored main feedwater, there was no evidence of any
damage or equipment failure that would have prevented aligning main feedwater per normal post-
trip response procedures.
CAUSAL FACTORS
Troubleshooting determined the cause of the event was an intermittent high resistance connection in the
rod control system moveable regulation circuitry. This high resistance was the result of insulation that
was inappropriately inserted into a crimped lug connection lessening the effectiveness of the electrical
connection. The bad crimp resulted in a loss of power to the moveable grippers causing them not to
engage the control rods. The connection was made during initial plant construction and degraded over
time.

A cause evaluation determined the direct cause of the inadequate connection was inadequate work
practices performed by the vendor at the time of construction. During that time, adequate work
instructions and standards did not drive excellent craftmanship and instead relied on skill of the craft.
Current work practices and qualifications by both the vendor and site personnel follow rigorous
procedures and work practices to ensure electrical connections are adequately constructed.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
1(cid:9) Replace inadequate wire crimp discovered during initial troubleshooting (complete).
2. Ensure adequate standards and work instructions to support flawless execution of crimping
connections (complete).
3. Update single point vulnerability strategy for affected cards to reflect the crimped connection
failure mode and take actions as necessary to ensure the failure mode is effectively
managed (planned).
4. Revise Long Term Asset Management risk matrix to reflect the risk of operation with single
point vulnerability installed (planned).
SAFETY ANALYSIS
The manual Catawba Unit 2 reactor trip described in the event report is considered to be an
uncomplicated reactor trip event with no significant impact on public health and safety. A post-trip
review found no critical procedure or human performance issues with the operator response to the
event. Therefore, it is concluded that the conditional core damage probability for the Unit 2 reactor
trip was very low and did not cause a significant increase in risk to the public. The plant was
returned to Mode 1 on April 26, 2022. No equipment important to plant safety was out of service at
the time of the reactor trip. There was no radioactive release to the atmosphere during this event.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
There have been no previous Licensee Event Reports at Catawba Nuclear Station in the last 3
years with the same causal factor as this issue.
