On May 2, 2023, during planned Engineered Safety Features Actuation System Testing, a Tower Actuation (TA) signal
occurred. The TA occurred due to the failure of the first level undervoltage load shedding scheme to shed loads from the 4KV
bus prior to the Service Water (SW) Ocean Pumps coasting down following the opening of the 4KV supply breaker. With no
power to the bus, and the SW Ocean Pumps breakers still closed, a low SW pump discharge pressure condition occurred,
resulting in the TA logic being satisfied. Troubleshooting determined that a defective relay contact in the first level undervoltage
load shedding scheme caused the failure. The relay was replaced, and the system was returned to service. There was minimal
impact to the station due the unplanned actuation, therefore this event had no impact on the health and safety of the public. In
addition, there were no other Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that contributed to this event. This event is being
reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for actuation of the emergency service water system that does not normally run
that serves as the ultimate heat sink.

NARRATIVE
Description
On May 2, 2023, the plant was in Mode 5 at 0 percent power with coolant temperature less than 200 degress fahrenheit and
depressurized, during planned Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) [ENS: JE] testing, a Tower Actuation
(TA) signal occurred. A TA signal is initiated to transfer Service Water (SW) (EIIS: BI) from the ocean when one of two
ocean pumps [EIIS: P] is running (in a train) with pump discharge pressure below the low pressure TA setpoint. The TA
signal is time delayed by 3 seconds to prevent spurious operation.
During the planned ESFAS testing, the combination of a loss of offsite power to the 4 KV bus [EIIS: BU], and Safety
Injection (SI) is simulated by simultaneous removal of the safeguards bus protection relay fuses [EIIS: FU], with the
actuation of a Si signal. Removal of the bus protection fuses de-energizes both the first and second level undervoltage relay
schemes, which also inputs to the Emergency Power Sequencer (EPS). The EPS opens the offsite power source breaker
[EIIS: BKR] to the 4 KV bus. The undervoltage schemes shed the loads from the bus.
Troubleshooting determined that the load shedding did not occur at the expected time delay (1.2 seconds) associated with
the first level undervoltage protection. Instead load shedding occurred at 6 seconds after the test initiation. Six seconds is
the time delay associated with load shedding on a second level undervoltage relay actuation coincident with a SI signal
present. The Ocean SW pumps remained connected to the 4KV bus for 6 seconds following initiation of the test. With the
offsite power supply removed, the pumps coasted down resulting in discharge pressure continuing to decrease to the tower
actuation setpoint prior to 6 seconds.
The Tower actuation occurred due to the failure of the first level undervoltage load shedding scheme to shed loads from the
4KV bus prior to the SW Ocean Pumps coasting down following the opening of the 4KV Bus supply breaker. With no power
to the bus, and the SW Ocean Pump breakers still closed, combined with the subsequent low SW pump discharge
pressure, the Tower Actuation logic was satisfied. Troubleshooting determined that a defective relay contact in the first level
undervoltage load shedding scheme caused the failure. The relay was replaced, and the system was returned to service.
Cause of the Event
Complex troubleshooting was performed in accordance with station processes. As part of the troubleshooting, the cause of
this event was determined to be a failure of a relay contact in the load shedding circuit. The relay was made by
Westinghouse and is a time delay starting relay.
Analysis of the Event
This licensee event report is being reported pursuant of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) for actuation of emergency service water
system that does not normally run and that serves as ultimate heat sinks. This event did not result in a Safety System
Functional Failure.
Safety Significance
There were no safety consequences due to this event. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public. In
addition, there were no other Structures Systems or Components (SSCs) that contributed to this event.
