On May 24, 2021, at 0915 eastern daylight time (EDT), SQN Unit 1 experienced an automatic reactor trip.(cid:9) Approximately
0.5 seconds before the reactor trip, an unexpected Rod Control Urgent Failure alarm annunciated and Control Bank B,
Group 2 rods began to lower. The reactor trip first out alarm indicated the trip was from a Power Range High Neutron Flux
Rate detected by the Power Range Nuclear Instruments.
During troubleshooting, it was discovered that there were bad pin connections on the backplane of the phase card
associated with Control Bank B (the card connection between the Control Bank B, Group 2 stationary gripper phase
control card and the backplane of its card cage).
All plant safety systems responded as designed. All rods fully inserted as required.
The direct cause of the failure has been attributed to the card connection between Control Bank B Group 2 stationary
gripper phase control card and the backplane of the card cage. Periodic instruction procedure, PI-674 Periodic Calibration
of the Full Length Rod Control Power, directs activities to remove phase control cards during calibration which can result
in pin deformation. Therefore, the corrective action for this event is to revise the procedure to modify how calibration
activities are performed based on learnings obtained from the equipment failure evaluation.

NARRATIVE
Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event
At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately
100 percent rated thermal power (RTP).
II.(cid:9) Description of Event
A. Event Summary:
On May 24, 2021, at 0915 eastern daylight time (EDT), SQN Unit 1 experienced an automatic
reactor trip. Approximately 0.5 seconds before the reactor trip, an unexpected Rod Control
Urgent Failure alarm annunciated and Control Bank B, Group 2 rods [EllS: AA] began to
lower. The reactor trip first out alarm indicated the trip was from a Power Range High
Neutron Flux Rate detected by the Power Range Nuclear Instruments. No rod testing was in
progress. No work was in progress in the rod control power or logic cabinets.
During troubleshooting. it was discovered that there were bad pin connections [EIIS: CON] on
the backplane of the phase control card [EIIS: ECBD] associated with Control Bank B (the
card connection between the Control Bank B, Group 2 stationary gripper phase control card
and the backplane of its card cage). The phase card was replaced and tested. Pin
reformation (the scope of pin reformation consisted of all five rod control power cabinets and
the logic cabinet) and system functional testing was performed by the vendor.
All plant safety systems responded as designed. All rods fully inserted as required.
The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as an event that
resulted in an automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System [EIIS: JC] and the
Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System [EIIS: BA].
B. Status of structures. components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event
and contributed to the event:
No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event.

III.(cid:9) Cause of the Event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error:
The direct cause of the failure has been attributed to the card connection between Control Bank B
Group 2 stationary gripper phase control card and the backplane of its card cage.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause:
There was no identified human performance related root cause.
IV.(cid:9) Analysis of the Event:
The plant safety system responses during and after the reactor trip were bounded by the
responses described in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The UFSAR
Chapter 15 event that most closely matches the reactor trip is the Rod Cluster Control Assembly
Misalignment. Therefore, this event did not adversely affect the health and safety of plant
personnel or the general public.
Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no actual safety consequences as a result of the reactor trip.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the
components and systems that failed during the event:
None.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,
remove residual heat. control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the
consequences of an accident:
The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down.
C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed
time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service:
There was no failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable.
VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP)
under condition report number 1696187.

A. Immediate Corrective Actions:
Troubleshooting was performed. It was discovered that there were bad pin connections on
the backplane of the phase card associated with Control Bank B. The phase card was
replaced and tested. Pin reformation (the scope of pin reformation consisted of all five rod
control power cabinets and the logic cabinet) and system functional testing was performed by
the vendor.
B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring
in the future:
Periodic instruction procedure, PI-674 Periodic Calibration of the Full Length Rod Control Power,
directs activities to remove phase control cards during calibration which can result in pin
deformation. Therefore, the corrective action for this event is to revise the procedure to modify
how calibration activities are performed based on learnings obtained from the equipment failure
evaluation.
VII. Previous Similar Events at the Same Site:
A review of previous similar events at SQN, identified LERs 1-2015-001 and 1-2019-003. Both
LERs identified an automatic reactor trip due to a control rod, H-8, dropping into the core. For
LER 1-2015-001, the cause of the event was failure of a maintenance procedure to provide
inspection guidance and acceptance criteria on control rod drive mechanism vertical panel
connections. The associated corrective action was revising the maintenance procedure and
periodic preventive maintenance of CRDM connections. For LER 1-2019-003, the cause of the
event was determined to be that excessive wear to the control rod stationary gripper latch
mechanism resulted in the inability to maintain the control rod in the fully, or nearly fully,
withdrawn position for an extended period of time. The corrective action was to submit a license
amendment request and develop an engineering design change to permanently remove Control
Rod H-8.
VIII. Additional Information
There is no additional information.
IX. Commitments:
There are no commitments.
