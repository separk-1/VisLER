On February 26, 2021, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 and Unit 2 were operating at 100 percent power when an electrical
fault occurred between the high side of the Reserve Feed Auxiliary Transformer (RAT) and associated breaker on the Train B
Reserve Feed for both units. This caused the circuit breakers to open, removing access to one of the two immediate offsite
power sources, and Unit 1 and Unit 2 Train B Reserve Feed was declared inoperable.(cid:9) The Train A Reserve Feed offsite
power source, all four Emergency Diesel Generators, and the backup offsite power source remained fully functional.
Field investigations resulted in finding a failed bus structure in a loop feed enclosure, which supplied both units.(cid:9) Due to the
extensive troubleshooting time required to identify the cause of the problem, enforcement discretion was requested to allow
exceeding the 72 hour completion time of Required Action A.3 of Technical Specification 3.8.1 AC Sources - Operating, by
an additional 48 hours to complete repairs.(cid:9) Enforcement discretion was granted and repairs were completed on
March 2, 2021, within the period of enforcement discretion. The cause of the issue was due to insulator contamination and
moisture inside the enclosure. Heaters were installed to prevent condensation of moisture inside the enclosure.
The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical
Specifications.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On February 26, 2021, at 1008, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 and Unit 2 were operating at 100 percent
power when multiple alarms indicated in both control rooms that 1-TR101AB and 2-TR201AB, Units 1 and 2
Train B Reserve Feed Auxiliary Transformers (RATs) [EA][XFMR] electrically isolated and de-energized.
Operators entered alarm response procedures and suspected the condition was due to an electrical transient.
Operations staff declared Train B Reserve Feed inoperable for both units, entering required actions for Limiting
Conditions of Operation (LCO) 3.8.1 AC Sources — Operating, Condition A and Condition D. The Train A Reserve
Feed offsite power source, all four Emergency Diesel Generators [EK][DG], and the backup offsite power source
remained fully functional. Essential Service Water cross-tie valves [BI][A were closed by operators at 1154,
exiting LCO 3.8.1 AC Sources — Operating, Condition D.
Initial investigations by station staff found no external visual abnormalities near either unit's RATs or in the
switchyard. Transformer 1-TR101AB and 2-TR201AB Phase 1 Lead Differential Relay 12-87-TABLD-1 [EA][87]
was found tripped.
A clearance for reserve feed power was implemented to facilitate additional testing and inspections. Oil samples
were obtained and tested from the RATs and indicated satisfactory results. Tan Delta testing was performed of
the Phase A cables from the switchyard to the 12AB Loop Feed Enclosure and from the 12AB Loop Feed
Enclosure to the RATs with satisfactory results. The 12AB Loop Feed Enclosure upper bus was megger tested
with unsatisfactory results. A borescope visual inspection of the upper bus duct was performed and indicated
physical evidence of an electrical fault. After removing the top of the upper bus duct, a visual inspection of the
inside portion revealed signs of a phase to ground fault and indications of arc tracking along the insulating boots.
Additionally, there was evidence of insulator contamination and moisture within the enclosure.
Due to the extensive troubleshooting time required to identify the cause of the problem and the scope of repairs,
enforcement discretion was requested to allow exceeding the 72 hour completion time of Required Action A.3 of
Technical Specification 3.8.1 AC Sources — Operating, by an additional 48 hours to complete repairs. Without
enforcement discretion, Unit 1 and Unit 2 were required to be in MODE 3 by 0408 on March 1, 2021, and Mode 5
by 1008 on March 2, 2021. Enforcement discretion (EA-21-04; ADAMS Accession Number: ML21063A568) was
granted per phone conversation, for an additional 48 hours on February 28, 2021, which would expire on
March 3, 2021 at 1008.
Temporary heaters were installed at the 12AB and 12CD Loop Feed Enclosures, to prevent condensation of
moisture inside of the enclosures. The faulted bus was splice-repaired, successfully post-maintenance tested,
and the loop feed enclosure was re-terminated. Power was restored and Train B Reserve Feed was declared
operable and exited the LCO on March 2, 2021, at 0522 within the period of enforcement discretion.
The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), Operation or Condition Prohibited by
Technical Specifications, due to exceeding the 72 hour completion time of Required Action A.3 of Technical
Specification 3.8.1 AC Sources — Operating.

NARRATIVE
CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The loss of both Unit 1 and Unit 2 Train B Reserve Feed from an electrical fault was due to contamination and
moisture inside 12AB Loop Feed Enclosure.
A causal evaluation is ongoing at the time of this report. A supplement to this LER will be provided if the results
of the evaluation significantly change the perception of the course, significance, implications, or consequences of
the event or if it results in substantial changes in corrective actions planned.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Prompt Corrective Actions
In addition to completing repairs to the damaged electrical bus, temporary heaters were installed at the 12AB and
12CD Loop Feed Enclosures, to prevent moisture condensation inside of the enclosures.
Planned Corrective Actions
Install permanent heaters in 12AB and 12CD Loop Feed Enclosures.
Implement revised preventive maintenance frequency and scope of 12AB and 12CD Loop Feed Enclosures.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
NUCLEAR SAFETY
There was no actual nuclear safety hazards resulting from the loss of Unit 1 and Unit 2 Train B Reserve Feed.
The Train A Reserve Feed offsite power source, all four Emergency Diesel Generators, and the backup offsite
power source remained fully functional during the event.
INDUSTRIAL SAFETY
There was no actual or potential industrial safety hazard resulting from the event.

NARRATIVE
PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT
A PRA was performed for a fault current observed between high side of the RAT and associated breaker on the
Train B Reserve Feed for both Unit 1 and Unit 2. This condition caused the associated circuit breakers to open,
removing access to the Train B Reserve Feed offsite power sources at both units. During the event, neither unit
tripped, so, the safety impact from this event results only from having one train of reserve feed unavailable for
each unit for the period the event persisted. The duration of the event was approximately 91.25 hours. A measure
of the overall safety impact was estimated using CNP's internal events and Fire PRA models. Comparing the
model results to the thresholds in IMC 0609 showed that the impact of the event was of Very Low Safety
Significance for both Unit 1 and Unit 2.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
A review of Licensee Event Reports for the past five years found no events due to similar causes.
