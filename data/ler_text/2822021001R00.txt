On January 26, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP), 12 Diesel Driven Cooling Water Pump (DDCLP)
auto started. Maintenance was in progress on 22 DDCLP and 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) was aligned
as the replacement safety related pump for 22 DDCLP while non-safety related 21 Cooling Water (CL) pump was supporting
the system loads. The 12 DDCLP auto started on a sensed low header pressure following the isolation of 22 Cooling Water
Strainer for maintenance and subsequent auto initiation of backwash of the other Cooling Water Strainers.
This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation.
There were no nuclear safety impacts. The system operated as designed. All systems responded normally.
The direct cause of this event was low pressure at the discharge of 12 DDCLP due to the isolation of the Cooling Water
Strainer while 22 DDCLP was isolated during low CL system flow conditions.
The corrective actions included securing the 12 DDCLP. In addition, procedure updates are planned.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION
On January 26, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP), Units 1 and Unit 2, were both in Mode 1
(Power Operation) at 100 percent power. The total Cooling Water (CL) system operating flow rates were in the range that
operation of only one CL pump was desired. Non-safety related train B 21 CL Pump was supporting all the CL system
loads for both trains of CL while the train B 22 Diesel Driven Cooling Water Pump (DDCLP) was out of service for
maintenance and the 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) was aligned as the train B replacement safety-
related pump. At 1044 CST, the train A 12 DDCLP auto started on a sensed low header pressure following the isolation of
22 Cooling Water Strainer for maintenance and subsequent auto initiation of backwash of the other Cooling Water
Strainers which reduced system pressure slightly. The 12 DDCLP is designed to start automatically if the CL discharge
header pressure drops to 75 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for 15 seconds.
This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation per
NUREG 1022, Revision 3.
EVENT ANALYSIS
The 12 DDCLP is a part of the PINGP CL System (EIIS CODE: BI). The CL system is a ring header which is shared by
Units 1 and 2 that provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operational heat from safety-related components
during a design basis accident or transient. During normal and shutdown operation, the CL system also provides this
function for various safety-related and non-safety related components. The CL system consists of a common CL pump
discharge header for five CL pumps: two non-safety related pumps, two safety related DDCLPs, and 121 MDCLP that can
be aligned as replacement for either DDCLP by realigning its power supply and administratively disabling the CL pump
discharge header valves to direct flow to the appropriate train.
With 121 MDCLP replacing 22 DDCLP on train B, the operating 21 CL pump supplied the ring header via train B and back
fed to train A, creating a lower pressure at the discharge of 12 DDCLP than what is indicated in the control room. The
isolation of 22 Cooling Water Strainer and subsequent auto backwash of the other Cooling Water strainers further reduced
pressure to the 12 DDCLP auto start setpoint.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
The auto start of 12 DDCLP did not challenge nuclear safety as all plant systems responded as designed. This event does not
represent a safety system functional failure for Unit 1 or Unit 2. There were no radiological, environmental, or industrial impacts
associated with this event. The health and safety of the public and site personnel were not impacted during this event.
CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The direct cause of this event was low pressure at the discharge of 12 DDCLP due to the isolation of the Cooling Water
Strainer while 22 DDCLP was isolated during low CL system flow conditions.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Operations restored CL system pressure by returning 22 CL Strainer to service, securing 12 DDCLP, and operating 11 CL
pump through the duration of the 22 DDCLP maintenance.
Procedure updates to perform mitigating actions while performing DDCLP and Cooling Water Strainer maintenance is a
planned corrective action.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS
No previous similar events have occurred at PINGP in the prior 3 years.
