On November 15, 2021, at approximately 1728 EST with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 47 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped
due to a fault on the B-phase of the main transformer. The turbine tripped automatically based on the reactor trip signal.
Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuation occurred as expected due to the low-low steam generator water levels which occurred
as a result of the reactor trip.(cid:9) The reactor trip was not complex with all systems responding normally post trip.(cid:9) Operations
stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Decay heat was removed by the steam generators, utilizing the steam dump system.
Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of the EFW system, this event is
being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).

NARRATIVE
1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
On November 14, 2021, at approximately 1141 EST, VCSNS closed the main generator breaker, concluding refueling
outage 26. Normal startup was in progress. On November 15, 2021, at approximately 1728 EST with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at
47 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to a fault on the B-phase of the main transformer (XTF0001). The
turbine tripped automatically based on the reactor trip signal. Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuation occurred as
expected due to the low-low steam generator water levels which occurred as a result of the reactor trip. The reactor trip
was not complex with all systems responding normally post trip. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Decay heat
was removed by the steam generators, utilizing the steam dump system.
There were no other structures, systems, or components (SSCs) that were inoperable at the beginning of the event or
contributed to the event.
Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of the EFW system, this event
is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).
2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS
XTF0001 serves no safety related purpose for the unit. When the transformer failed, all of the appropriate safety systems
responded as designed. The main generator, turbine, reactor, and EFW system operated as expected; and all the control
rods fully inserted into the core. The operating crew performed as expected. The event was within the analysis of the
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15. This event did not pose a threat to the health and safety of the public.
Therefore, the safety significance of this issue is very low.
3.0 CAUSE OF THE EVENT
The fault was caused by a failure of the center phase high-voltage bushing. Substantial evidence supports that an
electrical failure occurred inside the bushing itself. Failure analysis indicates that it is most probable that the H2 bushing
failed due to one or more manufacturing defects. Specifically, erroneous layers of paper insulation and a large surface
defect on the conductor.
4.0 IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
The faulted transformer was removed from service and replaced with the spare main transformer. The unit was placed
back online with breakers closed on December 10, 2021.
5.0 ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
None

NARRATIVE
6.0 ACTIONS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE
A new high voltage composite bushing design was selected to be utilized in the new replacement transformer design.
A vendor surveillance plan for the manufacturing and testing of the high voltage bushings for the replacement transformer
is being developed and will be implemented to provide confidence that manufacturing defects are identified and addressed
prior to installation.
7.0 SIMILAR EVENTS
On August 28, 2017, VCSNS Unit 1 automatically tripped due to a turbine trip. The turbine trip was caused by the Main
Generator Differential Lockout due to a fault on the center phase, 230 kV lightning arrester, on the main transformer. This
is described in LER 2017-003-01 (ML17347A216).
8.0 MANUFACTURER/PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER
The failed center phase high-voltage bushing was manufactured by ABB and is an ABB O+C 230kV 900kV BIL 4000A oil
impregnated bushing.
The main transformer was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. The Mitsubishi Design Number is HE11343.
The transformer was purchased under P.O. Number NU-02NN728893.
