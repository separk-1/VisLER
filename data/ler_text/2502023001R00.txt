Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On April 15, 2023, while in Mode 6, it was determined that the Reactor Coolant System (RCS)
Pressure Boundary did not meet ASME Section XI, Table IWB-341 0-1, Acceptable Standards, after a
rejectable indication was identified during non-destructive testing on the Flux Mapper Seal Table
Guide Tube H-6. The cause of the through-wall leak was intergranular stress-corrosion cracking
(IGSCC) and was corrected by repairing the flux mapper guide tube prior to startup from the planned
refueling outage. The safety significance of this event was low. No safety system actuation was
required. The through-wall leakage was non-quantifiable and well within RCS makeup capability. No
safety margins were challenged or reduced. This event is being reported pursuant of 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A), Degraded Condition, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), Condition Prohibited by
Technical Specifications.

Narrative
Description
On April 15, 2023, while in Mode 6, it was determined that the Reactor Coolant System (RCS)
Pressure Boundary did not meet ASME Section XI, Table IWB-341 0-1, Acceptable Standards, after a
rejectable indication was identified during non-destructive testing on the Flux Mapper Seal Table
Guide Tube H-6.
Cause of the Event
The most likely cause of the through-wall crack is intergranular stress-corrosion cracking (IGSCC).
For IGSCC to occur, the following factors must be present: susceptible material, environment, and
stress. The pressure stresses due to RCS pressure and the stress intensification of the geometry (i.e.
the shoulder) contributed to the crack propagation. Additionally, the observed cracks and deterioration
occurred in a sensitized region of the tube material, making it more susceptible to IGSCC.
Analysis of the Event
This license event report is being reported pursuant of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A), Degraded Condition,
and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications, since the indication
was most likely present prior to the planned refueling outage.
This event did not result in a Safety System Functional Failure.
Safety Significance
This safety significance of this event was low. No safety system actuation was required. The through-
wall leakage was non-quantifiable and well within RCS makeup capability. No safety margins were
challenged or reduced. Post-event evaluation determined that the condition did not affect the
structural ability of the guide tubes.
Corrective Actions
The affected guide tube was corrected by removing guide tube stub from below the seal table. An
engineered patch plate was added to the seal table as well as an extra coupling on the guide tube.
These actions were completed prior to startup.
Similar Events
A review of reportable events dating back 10 years, did not identify any previous events or conditions
that involved the same underlying cause as this event.
