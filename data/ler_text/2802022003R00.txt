As part of planned maintenance beginning on 7/29/2022 to 9/15/2022, the air handling unit (AHU) fan V-belts for both of the
Unit 1 Emergency Switchgear Room (ESGR) cooling trains (1-VS-AC-6 and 1-VS-AC-7) were replaced. When the AHU was
placed in-service, these V-belts eventually failed resulting in the inoperability of one or both of the AHU(s).
The cause of this event was that the V-belt vendor sent a different variant of the BX-99 V-belt ordered (Torq Titan vs. the Grip
Notch V-belt expected) and these belts were inadvertently accepted and installed at the station. Contributing to this cause was
that there were missed opportunities to recognize that the new V-belts were not the same design as those being replaced.
There were no safety consequences because of this event since the maximum temperature in the room stayed well below the
design basis upper limit. Planned corrective actions include procedural enhancements and coaching of personnel to ensure
that the parts received at the station comply with those ordered.

NARRATIVE
PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT
Surry Power Station (SPS) Units 1 and 2 were at 100% power.
1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT (EIIS codes are identified in the text as [XX])
The Main Control Room/Emergency Switchgear Room (MCR/ESGR) ventilation subsystem [VK] provides fresh air and
recirculates and cools the air for personnel and equipment concerns, and the emergency portion of the system supplies
provide a source of filtered fresh air to these areas in the event of a nuclear or chemical release.
Air conditioning (A/C), breathing air, and associated equipment are Seismic Class I within the missile-protected boundary
and powered from emergency buses to ensure operation during both normal and emergency conditions. Two (2) 100%
redundant air handling units (AHUs) [AHU], fed from different power sources, are provided for the ESGR and Relay Room
(RR) of each unit. Each AHU is supplied chilled water by one of five chillers [CHU] connected to the same power source
as the respective AHU. For the AHU fan [FAN], there are two (2) matched rubber V-belts installed.
The system is designed to limit temperatures in occupied spaces to less than 100°F and in non-occupied spaces to less
than 120°F. The AHUs, which serve the Unit 1 ESGR, are 1-VS-AC-6 (powered from the 1J bus) and 1-VS-AC-7
(powered from the 1H bus).
The design basis of the MCR and ESGR air conditioning system (ACS) [ACU] is to maintain the MCR/ESGR envelope
temperature within the equipment design limits for 30 days of continuous occupancy after a design basis accident (DBA).
The ACS includes five (5) chillers (1-VS-E-4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and 4E). The chillers supply chilled water to eight (8) AHUs
arranged in two (2) independent and redundant chilled water loops.
On 7/29/2022, as part of planned preventative maintenance on the ESGR AHUs, the V-belts on 1-VS-AC-7 were replaced
with the same stock number V-belts that have been in-service at Surry Power Station (SPS) for many years. However, the
AHU was not placed in-service until 9/14/2022. At that time, SPS personnel were unaware that the V-belts installed had
been replaced by the manufacturer from the “old style” Grip Notch V-belts to the “new-style” Torq Titan V-belts.
On 9/16/2022, 1-VS-AC-7 was secured due to a belt slapping noise. An investigation revealed that one of the two belts
had come off the sheaves. A new set of Torq Titan V-belts was installed and tensioned after a satisfactory alignment and
sheave check were performed.
On 9/15/2022, preventative maintenance was performed on 1-VS-AC-6 that also installed the new Torq Titan V-belts.
Those V-belts failed on 9/17/2022 and were replaced with another set of Torq Titan V-belts after an alignment and sheave
check. At this point SPS believed issues with both AHUs had been corrected.
On 9/18/2022, the V-belts on 1-VS-AC-7 failed again and were replaced with Torq Titan V-belts. This time an alignment
check was performed using a laser alignment tool and the belts were “run in” for four (4) hours, followed by satisfactory
vibration readings prior to returning the AHU to operable status.

NARRATIVE
On 9/19/2022, the V-belts on 1-VS-AC-7 failed once again. At that point it was concluded that maintenance fundamentals
were not responsible for the failures and further investigation was performed. An older set of Grip Notch V-belts was
found, and a side-by-side comparison made between the new and old V-belts. At this time, it was realized that the V-
belts were not the same and that the vendor had changed the V-belt line without first notifying the station (as required in
the purchase order). The older Grip Notch V-belts were subsequently installed on 1-VS-AC-7 with satisfactory
performance to date. Also, on 9/19/2022, 1-VS-AC-6 was declared inoperable since it also had Torq Titan V-belts
installed. Those V-belts were subsequently replaced, and the train declared operable on 9/22/2022.
As evidenced by numerous malfunctions of the installed Torq Titan V-belts, it was concluded that neither ESGR cooling
train would have been able to perform its 30-day mission time safety function with these V-belts installed. A total of five
(5) sets of Torq Titan V-belts were installed associated with the preventative maintenance or to replace failed belts.
The new-style Torq Titan V-belts were installed on 1-VS-AC-7 from 7/29/2022 to 9/19/2022, which resulted in that train
being considered inoperable. During this same period, the older-style Grip Notch V-belts were installed on 1-VS-AC-6
until replaced with the new-style Torq Titan belts on 9/15/2022. This resulted in one (1) train of ESGR cooling being
operable until 9/15/2022. Technical Specification (TS) 3.23(A)(2)(a)(1) requires that an inoperable train is to be restored
within 7-days or be in cold shutdown within the next 36 hours upon the loss of one (1) cooling train. In this case, the
Allowed Outage Time (AOT) required action statement was not met.
Additionally, between 9/15/2022 and 9/19/2022, the Torq Titan V-belts were installed on both cooling trains which resulted
in both being inoperable. With neither train operable, the TS 3.23(A)(2)(a)(3) AOT action statement requires that one (1)
train be restored to operable status within one (1) hour or be in cold shutdown within the next 36 hours. This required
action also was not met.
Due to these two (2) instances, an operation or condition prohibited by the station TSs occurred, which is reportable per
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). Also as mentioned previously, between 9/15/2022 and 9/19/2022, the new-style belts were
installed on both cooling trains (1-VS-AC-6 and -7), which resulted in the Unit 1 ESGR having no operable means of
cooling. This is a loss of safety function that is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A). Finally, due to the loss of both
trains due to a similar cause, a common-cause failure situation existed that is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii).
2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS
There were no safety consequences from this event. The safety-related equipment within the room has an operating
temperature limit of 120°F, which meant that the ambient temperature would have had to exceed 110°F before the
equipment would be considered inoperable. During the 4-day period when both cooling trains were unavailable,
information obtained from the plant logs showed the actual recorded room temperature to be in the mid to upper 70°F
range. Consequently, the room temperature never approached the 110°F limit before restoring one (1) AHU to operable
status on 9/19/2022. Also, by procedure, operators are required to shut down the unit if the temperature limit is exceeded.
3.0 CAUSE OF EVENT
The cause of this event was that the V-belt vendor sent a different variant of the BX-99 V-belt ordered (Torq Titan vs. the
Grip Notch V-belt expected) and these V-belts were inadvertently accepted and installed at the station. Contributing to
this cause was that there were missed opportunities to recognize that the new V-belts were not the same design as the V-
belts being replaced.

2022 -(cid:9) 003(cid:9) - 00
NARRATIVE
In July 2021, due to decreasing station stock, a purchase order (PO) for additional BX-99 Grip Notch V-belts was placed.
These belts were commercially dedicated by Dominion Energy since there are no Appendix B audited suppliers of these
belts, which have been used at the station for several years and have performed reliably. The PO specified 4 sets (of 2
belts each) with the Part#/Manufacturer listed as “BX-99 Browning.” The PO also contained dimensional criteria based on
the existing BX-99 Browning Grip Notch belt.
Upon delivery to the station, the belts were inspected against the PO acceptance criteria, accepted, and placed into stock.
Following the apparent cause evaluation into the event, it was revealed that the actual belts delivered were the “Browning
BX99 Torq Titan” rather than the “Browning BX-99 Grip Notch” belts ordered. Although the PO specified that Dominion
Energy be notified if a different belt line was used, it was later discovered that the vendor had substituted the belts since
the Grip Notch line had been discontinued. The substituted Torq Titan belts were very similar in appearance to the Grip
Notch belts, e.g., both belts have similar dimensions (within tolerances) for top width, length, and height, as well as
identification based on the generic industry standard BX-99 designs; however, it was later learned that there were
differences in the belt profile, which led to the belt failing.
4.0 IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Upon recognition of the replacement belt issue, the installed Torq Titan belts were replaced with Grip Notch belts.
5.0 ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
An extent of condition review revealed that the Browning Torq Titan belts had not been used in other safety-related A/C
equipment applications.
6.0 PLANNED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
1. Enhancements (e.g., use of pictures, etc.) will be made to the belt's procurement documents to enhance recognition of
and confirm that the parts ordered are the actual parts received at the station.
2. For each of the organizations involved, reinforce expectations about the importance of comparing parts before they are
accepted, inventoried, and/or installed in the plant.
3. Actively pursuing obtaining replacement V-belts from a different manufacturer.
7.0 SIMILAR EVENTS
No similar events have occurred at Surry Power Station within the last three (3) years.
8.0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
SPS Unit 1 and Unit 2 remained at 100% power throughout the repair and return to operability.
Failed Component: Browning BX-99 Torq Titan V-belt manufactured by Browning MFG/Emerson Power Transmission.
