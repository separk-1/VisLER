At 1646 on July 31, 2021, with Unit 1 operating in MODE 1 at full power, Operators removed Unit 1 from service by
manually tripping the reactor when operators identified control board indications warranting prompt removal of the reactor
from service.
All control rods fully inserted into the core due to the manual trip. The auxiliary feedwater system started as expected when
a valid system actuation occurred after the reactor trip. There was no emergency core cooling system actuation and offsite
power was maintained throughout the event. After the reactor trip, equipment anomalies occurred for which the operators
effectively responded.
The cause of the condition requiring the manual reactor trip was a failure of the main steam generator feedwater pump B
motor. Corrective actions included replacement of the main steam generator feedwater pump B motor and additional
maintenance activities for anomalies identified during the reactor trip.
This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).

NARRATIVE
Description of the Event:
At 1646 on July 31, 2021, with Unit 1 operating in MODE 1 at full power, Operators removed Unit 1 from service by
manually tripping the reactor [AC] when operators identified control board indications warranting prompt removal of the
reactor from service.
All control rods [JD] fully inserted into the core due to the manual trip. The auxiliary feedwater system [BA] started as
expected when a valid system actuation occurred after the reactor trip. There was no emergency core cooling system
actuation [JE] and offsite power [FK] was maintained throughout the event.
After the reactor trip, a condenser steam dump valve [JI] cycled and did not fully close. The valve was locally isolated to
prevent additional reactor [AC] cooldown. After the turbine trip, the crossover steam dump system motor operated valves
[SE] did not close. This caused main condenser [SG] vacuum conditions to deteriorate. This lead to main condenser
unavailability and the use of the atmospheric steam dump system. Field action was taken to close the crossover steam
dump valves. Additionally, during the feedwater transition, the main feedwater B regulating bypass valve [JB] did not
control in automatic and was taken to manual control.
This 60-day licensee event report is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).
Cause of the Event:
The cause of the manual reactor trip was due to the failure of main steam generator feedwater (SGFW) pump B motor
[EA][MO]. The root cause has been determined to be less than adequate manufacturing process controls for the stator
and rotor assembly. A misalignment between the stator and rotor resulted in periodic contact of the rotor to stator
eventually degrading the iron laminations and winding insulation to the point of failure of the stator winding.
The condenser steam dump valve [JI] condition was caused by the failure of its positioner [TC]. The crossover steam
dump valve [SE] condition was caused by the failure of a relay [RLY], and the feedwater regulating valve condition will be
investigated further during the next available opportunity.
Analysis of the Event:
The feedwater system is comprised of two half-capacity main SGFW pumps that deliver fluid to the secondary side of the
steam generators. The fluid is used to remove the heat generated in the reactor and to produce steam used for electrical
power generation.
The loss of the main SGFW pump motor required an immediate reduction in reactor power to support the limitations of a
single train of feedwater. At the time of the failure the reactor power was not low enough to support removal of one of the
two operating main SGFW pumps, which necessitated a manual reactor trip.
The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps started as expected on low steam generator level experienced due to reducing steam
demand from the turbine trip in response to the reactor trip.
After the reactor trip, all control rods fully inserted in the core due to the manual trip. There was no Emergency Core
Cooling System actuation. Offsite power was maintained throughout the event. The equipment anomalies that occurred
did not affect safety system functions.
Corrective Actions:
The anomalies experienced during the shutdown were diagnosed, and those requiring maintenance prior to reactor restart
were completed. The reactor was returned to service at reduced power and the main SGFW pump motor was replaced

prior to returning the reactor to full power. Additionally, procurement specifications will be updated to include industry
approved standards and oversight criteria for critical motor assembly.
Safety Significance:
During the event and subsequent recovery actions, there was no loss of any safety systems, structures, or components.
The auxiliary feedwater pumps started as expected during the transient. The main SGFW pump A remained available to
remove decay heat after the reactor trip. Plant systems anomalies occurred following the manual reactor trip. The
operating crew appropriately responded to the anomalies. Following the manual reactor trip, all control rods fully inserted
into the core as designed to control reactivity and temperature of the core. The reactivity effects during this event had no
impact on the safety of the core and thus, the event was determined to be of very low safety significance. There was no
impact on the health and safety of the public because of this event.
Similar Events:
There have not been similar events of manual reactor trips in the past three years with the same initiating condition.
