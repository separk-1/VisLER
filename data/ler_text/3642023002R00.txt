16. Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On October 3, 2023, while in Mode 1 at 92% power level, it was discovered that a Unit 2 Main Steam Safety Valve (MSSV)
failed its as-found lift pressure test. The MSSV lifted above the Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.1 allowable lift setting value.
Setpoint drift is the most likely cause of the MSSV setpoint failure.
It is likely that the MSSV was outside of the TS limits longer than the allowable completion times for the associated Required
Action Statements during the operating cycle in all applicable modes of operation. Therefore, this condition is being reported in
accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS.
The MSSV setpoint was adjusted to within the TS limits and returned to service restoring compliance. The MSSV that failed the
surveillance setpoint test was replaced with a refurbished valve during the 2R29 refueling outage and sent to vendor for
analysis.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION:
On October 3, 2023, at 1650 CDT, while operating in Mode 1 and at 92% power level, a B Loop Main Steam Safety Valve
(MSSV), Q2N11V0011C [EIIS:SB:RV] as-found lift pressure did not meet the acceptance criteria of +/- 3% of setpoint (1102
psig) as required by Technical Specifications (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.1.1. The MSSV lifted high at 1140
psig which is 5 psig outside of its acceptance range of 1069 to 1135 psig. The +/- 3% as-found lift pressure requirement is
an ASME Section III, 1971 edition, and Farley TS requirement to ensure that the MSSV provides adequate protection by
preventing the steam pressure from exceeding 110% of the main steam system design pressure.
EVENT ANALYSIS:
The MSSV (Manufacturer: Dresser, Model Number: 3707R, Serial Number: BP-09820) was sent to NWS Technologies for
failure analysis due to the failed as-found test. Setpoint drift is the most likely cause of the MSSV setpoint failure.
REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY EVALUATION:
This failure constitutes a condition that is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), "Any operation or condition
which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications." The applicable accident/transient analyses requires five
MSSVs per Steam Generator [EIIS:SB:SG] to provide overpressure protection for design basis transients occurring at
102% Rated Thermal Power. On October 3, 2023, MSSV Q2N11V0011C was found outside of its required setpoint range
and was declared inoperable. As it is not possible to determine when the valve exceeded the allowable setpoint range,
the MSSV was likely inoperable for greater than the TS allowed completion time. Based on the MSSV as-found lift setpoint
being less than 110% of design Steam Generator pressure (1194 psig), and properly reseating, this one MSSV failure did
not result in a loss of safety function.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
MSSV Q2N11V0011C was adjusted within TS tolerance and returned to operable status. Additonally, an expanded scope
inspection of MSSVs Q2N11V0011E and Q2N11V0011D was completed satisfactory. The MSSV (SN BP-09820) was
subsequently removed from its location during the 2R29 refueling outage for analysis and was replaced on October 17,
2023, with a refurbished valve that was heat soaked and placed in the Q2N11V0011C location at the required 1102 psig
+/-1%.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS:
A similar event was reported in 2017 (LER 2017-002-00) and in 2020 (LER 2020-001-01).
OTHER SYSTEMS IMPACTED:
No other systems were affected by this event.
