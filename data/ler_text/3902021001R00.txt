At 1511 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on March 1, 2021, a Main Control Room (MCR) alarm was received for low
control room positive pressure. In response to the alarm, a Control Room Envelope (CRE) door was found ajar and
immediately closed. Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.10, Control Room
Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS), was declared not met for both trains and Condition B entered. At 1513 EST
on March 1, 2021, the alarm cleared, CREVS was declared operable and LCO 3.7.10, Condition B was exited.
The direct cause of this event was a human performance error when an individual traversing the control building
complex did not fully challenge and ensure a MCR envelope boundary door was properly latched and secured.
Contributing to this event, standards had not been properly established, communicated, and reinforced with plant
staff related to operation of plant doors. Immediate corrective actions included closing the MCR door and coaching
the individual. Actions to reduce the probability of recurrence include the development and communication of
management expectations associated with operating plant doors.
This condition is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function
needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).

NARRATIVE
I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event
Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated thermal power (RTP) and
Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 90 percent RTP.
II. Description of Event
A. Event Summary
On March 1, 2021 at 1511 Eastern Standard Time (EST), a Main Control Room (MCR) alarm
was received for low control room positive pressure. In response to the alarm, a Control Room
Envelope (CRE) door {EIIS:DR} was found ajar and immediately closed. Technical
Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.10, Control Room Emergency
Ventilation System (CREVS) {EIIS:VI}, was declared not met for both trains and Condition B
entered. At 1513 EST on March 1, 2021, the alarm cleared, CREVS was declared operable
and LCO 3.7.10, Condition B was exited.
This event is being reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a
safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event and
that contributed to the event
No inoperable structures, systems, or components contributed to this condition.
C. Dates and approximate times of occurrences
Date Time (EST) Event
03/01/21 1511 MCR alarm was received for low control room pressue. TS
LCO 3.7.10 was declared no met for both trains and
Condition B entered. The MCR door was manually closed
and latched.
03/01/21 1513 Units 1 and 2 exited TS LCO 3.7.10, Condition B due to
annunciators clearing.
D. Manufacturer and model number of each component that failed during the event

E. Other systems or secondary functions affected
No other systems or secondary functions were affected.
F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error
Plant alarms indicated a low MCR positive pressure. The response procedure for low MCR
pressure requires that the MCR doors be checked for proper closure, at which time door C036
was found open.
G. Failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component
No equipment failures during this event
H. Operator actions
Operators performed the Alarm Response Instruction (ARI) and shut door C036.
I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses
The MCR low pressure alarm properly actuated when the pressure door was left open.
III.(cid:9) Cause of the Event
A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error
No equipment failures occurred during this event.
B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause
The direct cause of this event was a human performance error when an individual traversing the
control building complex did not fully challenge and ensure a MCR envelope boundary door was
properly latched and secured. Contributing to this event, standards had not been properly
established, communicated, and reinforced with plant staff related to operation of plant doors.

IV. Analysis of the Event
The CRE is required to be operable in Modes 1 through 6 and during movement of irradiated fuel
assemblies. Operability requires integrity of the CRE such that it will have a low unfiltered in-leakage
during accident conditions to maintain the dose to operators within the requirements of Criterion 19, of
10 CFR 50, Appendix A. Technical Specifications allow the CRE boundary to be opened intermittently
under administrative control, normally to allow routine personnel ingress and egress from the control
room envelope. Administrative controls in the case of boundary doors are that an individual is in
control of the door when it is opened.
On March 1, 2021, an individual traversing the control building complex did not fully challenge and
ensure the MCR boundary door C036 was properly latched and secured. This action left this door ajar,
resulting in operations personnel entering TS LCO 3.7.10, CREVS, for one or more CREVS trains
inoperable due to an inoperable CRE boundary. Low positive pressure (less than 0.125 inches of
water gauge WG) in the control room for 90 seconds results in a control room alarm. Upon receipt of
the alarm, the CRE door was promptly closed. For this event, the CRE boundary was restored
approximately two minutes after the MCR alarm was received. An engineering evaluation of a similar
event is bounding for this event, and concludes that General Design Criteria (GDC) 19 dose limits to
operators would not be exceeded when considering closure of the pressure boundary door for
accidents analyzed in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report.
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
A review of this event indicates, when considering the actual system capability and the response of
equipment and personnel, a loss of safety function capable of impacting public health and safety did
not occur with respect to the control room. This equipment is not analyzed in the site specific
Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), but the impact of this door on an accident would be very small.
A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the
components and systems that failed during the event
The CRE equipment designed to protect the pressure boundary remained operable.
B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or
components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, remove
residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an
accident
Not applicable
C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed time
from the discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service
For this event, the MCR envelope door was closed within two minutes of receipt of the MCR
alarm.

VI.(cid:9) Corrective Actions
This event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) Corrective Action Program and is
being tracked under Condition Report (CR) 1675314.
A. Immediate Corrective Actions
The open control room door was identified and promptly closed. The worker was coached on
this issue. Administrative controls were put in place to ensure proper door operation pending
further investigation.
B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring in
the future
Actions to reduce the probability of recurrence include the development and communication of
management expectations associated with operating plant doors. An effectiveness review plan
has been approved to track and validate improvement of future human performance behaviors
associated with proper door operation.
VII.(cid:9) Previous Similar Events at the Same Site
LER 391/2020-001-00, reported an instance where the control room boundary door had been left open
due to personnel error and promptly closed by operations in response to a low control room positive
pressure alarm. The cause of this event is similar.
There have been other events in with the MCR doors such as LER's 390/2020-003-00,390/2019-001-
00, 390/2019-004-00, 390/2018-003-00, 390/2018-004-00, 390/2017-007-001 and 390/2017-014-00
