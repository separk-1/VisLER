16. Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines)
On October 24, 2023, while at 0% power level and Mode 6 (refueling), it was discovered that a Unit 2 pressurizer code safety
valve (PSV), which had been removed during the refueling outage (2R29) and shipped off-site for testing, failed its as-found lift
pressure test. The PSV lifted above the Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10 allowable lift setting value. Setpoint drift of the PSV
is the most likely cause of the failure.
It is likely that the PSV was outside of the TS limits longer than allowable by the Required Action Statement (15 minutes) during
the previous operating cycle in all applicable modes of operation. Therefore, this condition is being reported in accordance with
10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS.
The PSV was replaced during the October 2023 refueling outage.

NARRATIVE
EVENT DESCRIPTION:
On October 24, 2023, while Unit 2 was at 0% power level and in Mode 6 (Refueling), with the Reactor Coolant System
(RCS) [AB] at atmospheric pressure and 91 degrees Fahrenheit, the 2C Pressurizer Code Safety Valve (PSV) [RV] (Serial #
N56963-01-0003, Manufacturer: Crosby; Model: HB-86-BP) was removed as part of the routine In-Service Testing (1ST)
program and sent to an off-site testing facility. The as-found lift pressure was discovered to be 2522 psig which was outside
of the Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10 allowable lift pressure settings of >/= 2423 psig and <1= 2510 psig. The tested
valve was within the ASME code acceptance band of +/- 3% (2411-2559 psig). Based on the lift pressure meeting the 1ST
program (ASME code) monitored requirements, there was no 1ST scope expansion for the PSV.
EVENT ANALYSIS:
Setpoint drift of the PSV was determined to be the most likely cause of the failure.
REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT:
This failure constitutes a condition that is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), "Any operation or condition which
was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications." There is no firm evidence, prior to the time of discovery at the test
facility, of when the failure occurred. Since the as-found lift setpoint was within ASME Code allowance and less than 110%
design pressure of the RCS, the condition did not have an adverse impact on its over-pressurization function. The as-found
lift pressure was 2522 psig, and the valve re-closed following the lift. There were no actual safety consequences for this
event. No safety system responses occurred. There was no release of radioactivity.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
The PSV was replaced during the October 2023 refueling outage. The as-left setpoints were within +1- 1% tolerance.
Previous corrective actions for PSV failures included a spring changeout campaign for all PSV's and TS 3.4.10 was also
previously revised. The 2C PSV that was removed was the last PSV in the spring changeout campaign.
PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS:
Similar events have been reported for Unit 1 and Unit 2.
