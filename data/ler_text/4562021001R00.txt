On April 23, 2021 at 1216 hours, with Unit 1 in Mode 2 during reactor startup activities, control room personnel identified
that both Train A and Train B source range neutron flux reactor trip functions were bypassed, and immediately restored
by taking the bypass switches to normal. The condition existed since April 21, 2021 at 0738 hours with the unit in Mode
5. In accordance with Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operations (LCO) 3.3.1, Reactor Trip System
(RTS) Instrumentation, the source range neutron flux channels are required in Modes 2, 3, 4 and 5 in accordance with
TS Table 3.3.1-1. A review determined periods where TS 3.3.1 Conditions were not met, and of mode changes not in
accordance with TS LCO 3.0.4.
The cause of the event was failure of the Operations crew to adequately track equipment status in accordance with
operating procedures and processes.
This event is being reported as any operation or condition which was prohibited by Technical Specifications in
accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), and as any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the
safety function needed to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition in accordance with 10 CFR
50.73(a)(2)(v)(A).

A. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event:
Event Date:(cid:9) April 23, 2021
Unit: 1(cid:9) MODE: 2(cid:9) Reactor Power: 000
Unit 1 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB]:(cid:9) Normal operating temperature and pressure
B. Description of Event:
No structures, systems or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to the event.
In accordance with Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operations (LCO) 3.3.1, Reactor Trip System
(RTS) Instrumentation, the source range neutron flux channels are required in Modes 3, 4 and 5 with rod control
system capable of rod withdrawal or one or more rods not fully inserted, and in Mode 2 when below the source
range block permissive interlock. A review determined periods where TS 3.3.1 Conditions were not met, and two
instances of mode changes not in accordance with TS LCO 3.0.4 Applicability during entry into Mode 4 and Mode 2
when both source range neutron flux reactor trip functions were inoperable.
On April 23, 2021, Unit 1 was completing refueling outage A1R22, and was starting up the reactor in Mode 2. At
1216 hours, control room personnel identified that Train A and Train B source range [IG] neutron flux reactor trip
functions were bypassed, and immediately restored by taking the bypass switches to normal. TS 3.3.1 Conditions
A, H, and I for both source range neutron flux functions inoperable were entered and exited accordingly.
A review determined that on April 21, 2021 at 0738 hours with Unit 1 in Mode 5, both source range neutron flux
trips were placed in bypass per procedure in support of switchyard activities. These activities included opening or
closing disconnects and could have caused electrical interference with the source range indication. Switching
activities were subsequently delayed for approximately four hours. At the completion of the switching activities, the
restoration of the source range neutron flux trips was not performed, and the trip functions remained in bypass until
discovery on April 23, 2021.
Applicable TS Conditions
• TS 3.3.1 Condition A (One or more Functions with one or more required channels or trains inoperable)
requires immediate entry into the Condition referenced in TS Table 3.3.1-1 (Reactor Trip System
Instrumentation) for the channel(s) or train(s).
-(cid:9) For the source range neutron flux trip function in Mode 2 below the source range block permissive, the
table directs entry into Conditions H and I.
-(cid:9) For the source range neutron flux trip function in Modes 3, 4 and 5 with the Rod Control System capable
of rod withdrawal or one or more rods not fully inserted, the table directs entry into Conditions I and J.
• TS 3.3.1 Condition H (One Source range Neutron Flux channel inoperable) Action H.1 is to immediately
suspend operations involving positive reactivity additions.
• TS 3.3.1 Condition I (Two Source range Neutron Flux channels inoperable) Action I.1 is to immediately open
the reactor trip breakers.

NARRATIVE
D. Safety Consequences:
There were no actual safety consequences impacting plant or public safety as a result of this issue. The safety
function of the source range neutron flux trips is to provide core protection for the following events:
1. Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) malfunction.
CVCS malfunction results in a decrease in boron concentration in the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). In
Modes 3, 4, and 5, a boron dilution event is mitigated by crediting operator action to respond to the dilution.
For all but two scenarios the primary indication is the Volume Control Tank (VCT) level alarm. For a slow
dilution event or a dilution during an RCS cooldown, the VCT level alarm won’t alert the operators in time to
mitigate the event. For those scenarios, multiple equivalent signals are available to the operators including the
source range detectors, boric acid/blended flow rate alarms, CVCS/reactor makeup pump lights. Since the
source range detectors are not the primary or sole means to mitigate a boron dilution event in any scenario
during Modes 3, 4, and 5, the analyses remain bounding and applicable without the source range reactor trip
function available.
2.(cid:9) The uncontrolled rod cluster control assembly bank withdrawal from a subcritical or low power startup
condition.
For this event, abbreviated as RWFS (Rod Withdrawal from Subcritical), the limiting analysis outlined in the
Braidwood UFSAR occurs during Mode 2 operation and credits the Power Range High Neutron Flux Reactor
Trip (low setting) to mitigate the event.
In Modes 3, 4, and 5, the source range reactor trip functions are credited for this event. Therefore, there was a
loss of safety function for the periods in Modes 3, 4, and 5 when the source range neutron flux trips were
bypassed while the Rod Control System was capable of rod withdrawal or one or more rods not fully inserted.
There were no safety consequences resulting from this event as there were alternate means of ensuring a
RWFS event in Modes 2, 3, 4, and 5 remained within the analysis. Standard practice is to ensure there is
sufficient RCS boron concentration during Modes 3, 4, 5, and 6 that even if a full set of rod control banks or
shutdown banks are withdrawn from the core, there is sufficient shutdown margin to avoid criticality while
maintaining shutdown margin requirements. A review of required and actual RCS boron concentration
throughout the event confirmed that RCS boron concentration remain above its minimum requirement. At no
time while the source range reactor trip functions were bypassed in Modes 2, 3, 4, and 5 would a RWFS be
able to achieve criticality, ensuring that the limiting RWFS event remained bounding.
E. Corrective Actions:
Corrective actions include addressing accountability with the individuals involved and implementing an observation
plan to improve the quality of control board walkdowns.
F. Previous Occurrences:
No previous, similar Licensee Event Reports were identified at the Braidwood Station in the past three years.
