On October 1, 2023 at 1022 hours with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, turbine
driven auxiliary feedwater control valve for the ‘A’ steam generator, 3FWA*HV36A, drove full close and then back to full
open, without a demand to close. 3FWA*HV36A cycled from open to close and back to open on September 4, 2023 and
October 5, 2023 without a demand to close. A past operability review determined that this reoccurring unexpected
condition provides evidence that the valve may not be relied upon when needed to perform its designed safety functions
for longer than allowed by Technical Specifications. The direct cause of failure was a degraded Target Rock controller/
positioner card, 3FWA*HY36A6. The card was replaced, calibrated, and the valve was retested satisfactorily. This report is
being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), as an operation or condition that was prohibited by the plant's

NARRATIVE
On October 1, 2023 at 1022 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power the
turbine driven auxiliary feedwater control valve for the ‘A’ steam generator, 3FWA*HV36A, changed its state to dual
position. Coincident with the valve going dual position, the control room received main board alarm MB1E “Turbine
Driven Auxiliary Feedwater System Bypass Annunciator.” 3FWA*HV36A went full closed and then returned to full
open position. The demand from the controller was for 100% open throughout. The 72-hour shutdown action
statements for Technical Specification 3.7.1.2 and 3.6.3 were entered at 1022 hours.
This was a similar occurrence from a condition which occurred on September 4, 2023. Troubleshooting was
performed to determine the cause of 3FWA*HV36A failure. The most probable failure was determined to be a
degraded relay logic card, 3FWA*HY36A4. The card was replaced, and the valve was stroked successfully from 100%
to 50% close and back to 100% open. The replacement of the 3FWA*HY36A4 card and subsequent satisfactory retest
restored the ability of the valve to perform its design basis function. The 72-hour shutdown action statements for
Technical Specification 3.7.1.2 and 3.6.3 were exited on October 3, 2023 at 0120 hours.
On September 4, 2023 at 0203 hours, 3FWA*HV36A went full closed and then reopened without any operator
actions. The 72-hour shutdown action statements for Technical Specification 3.7.1.2 and 3.6.3 were entered.
Troubleshooting was performed and an engineering technical evaluation was prepared to document the results and
to(cid:9) determine(cid:9) 3FWA*HV36A(cid:9) control(cid:9) valve(cid:9) reliability(cid:9) to(cid:9) perform(cid:9) its(cid:9) design(cid:9) function. The 72-hour shutdown
action statements for Technical Specification 3.7.1.2 and 3.6.3 were exited on September 6, 2023 at 1252 hours.
On October 5, 2023 at 1552 hours, 3FWA*HV36A indicated dual position. The valve went full closed at 1553 and
then(cid:9) reopened(cid:9) without(cid:9) any(cid:9) operator(cid:9) actions.(cid:9) The(cid:9) 72-hour(cid:9) shutdown(cid:9) action(cid:9) statements(cid:9) for(cid:9) Technical
Specification 3.7.1.2(cid:9) and(cid:9) 3.6.3(cid:9) were(cid:9) entered.(cid:9) Troubleshooting(cid:9) was(cid:9) initiated,(cid:9) the(cid:9) voltage(cid:9) to(cid:9) current(cid:9) card,
3FWA*HY36A5,(cid:9) was replaced. A temporary engineering change was implemented to install instrumentation to
monitor the control circuit for 3FWA*HV36A. An operability determination was developed and as a compensatory
action, fuses were removed to fail 3FWA*HV36A to its full-open position. In the event that 3FWA*HV36A would
need to be throttled for auxiliary feedwater flow control or closed for isolation of the ‘A’ steam generator,
instructions were provided to re-install the fuses to allow operators to control the valve as required(cid:9) by plant
conditions. The 72-hour shutdown(cid:9) action statements for Technical Specification 3.7.1.2 and 3.6.3 were exited on
October 8, 2023 at 1303 hours.
Further investigation and troubleshooting continued on 3FWA*HV36A during the refueling outage in October 2023.
The results obtained from the instrumentation installed per the temporary engineering change identified that the
Target Rock controller/positioner card, 3FWA*HY36A6, was the component that had caused the intermittent
failures.
3FWA*HV36A unexpectedly went closed and reopened on September 4, October 1, and October 5, 2023. A past
operability review determined that this reoccurring intermittent failure provides evidence that the valve may not be
relied upon when needed to perform its safety function. 3FWA*HV36A is required to support operability of the
turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump to provide water to the “A” steam generator. Due to the inability to identify
and correct the cause of failure, it resulted in the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump being inoperable for
longer than the 72 hours allowed outage time for TS 3.7.1.2 and TS 3.6.3.

NARRATIVE
Technical Specifications 3.7.1.2 Action c, requires, if one auxiliary feedwater pump is inoperable in operating modes
1, 2, and 3, the pump must be returned to operable status within 72 hours, or the plant must be placed in at least
hot standby within 6 hours and in hot shutdown within the following 12 hours.
3FWA*HV36A is required to be able to close for containment isolation per General Design Criteria (GDC) 57 for TS
3.6.3. With the valve not fully closed (or not capable of fully closing), TS action 3.6.3.d is not met (72-hour shutdown
action to manually isolate penetration).
For Modes 1, 2, 3, and 4 Technical Specification 3.6.3 requires the containment isolation valve to be OPERABLE. With
one or more of the isolation valve(s) inoperable, the required actions are to maintain at least one isolation barrier
OPERABLE in the affected penetration(s) and restore the inoperable valve(s) to OPERABLE status within 4 hours, or
isolate the affected penetration(s) within 4 hours by use of deactivated automatic valve(s) secured in the isolation
position(s), or Isolate the affected penetration(s) within 4 hours by use of closed manual valve(s) or blind flange(s);
or Isolate the affected penetration that has only one containment isolation valve and a closed system within 72
hours by use of at least one closed and deactivated automatic valve, closed manual valve, or blind flange; or be in at
least HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours and in COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours.
This condition is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by
the plant's technical specifications.
Discovery Date and Event Date:
On October 1, 2023, the station recognized from the second occurrence of unexpected valve movement of
3FWA*HV36A, that there was evidence that the event that occurred on September 4, 2023 had not been resolved
in a way that would prevent future reoccurrence. Therefore, the station is using October 1, 2023 as date of discovery
while September 4 2023 is considered as initial event date.
CAUSE
The direct cause of failure was a degraded Target Rock controller/positioner card - 3FWA*HY36A6.

NARRATIVE
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES
The primary safety function of the auxiliary feedwater (AFW) system is to provide a source of emergency feedwater to
any active steam generators (SG) so the steam generators can act as heat sinks for sensible and decay heat removal.
Two 50% capacity motor driven auxiliary feedwater (MDAFW) pumps, 3FWA*P1A and 3FWA*P1B, and one 100%
capacity turbine driven auxiliary feedwater (TDAFW) pump, 3FWA*P2, take suction from the demineralized water
storage tank (DWST) through independent suction lines. 3FWA*HV36A is located in the discharge line from the
TDAFW pump before it joins a common line from the “A” MDAFW pump delivering AFW to the “A” steam generator.
Sufficient AFW for plant cooldown can be supplied by either the TDAFW pump, or the pair of MDAFW pumps. This
arrangement protects against single failures and provides diversity between power sources. The amount of AFW
necessary to perform the heat removal function is captured in station procedures. The delivery of AFW is not
expressed on a per SG basis, but rather the total AFW flow delivered to all operating SGs necessary for decay heat
removal. The AFW system by design can deliver more AFW than is needed to perform the decay heat removal
function.
The first issue associated with the inadvertent closure of 3FWA*HV36A is the termination of expected AFW flow from
the TDAFW pump to the ‘A’ steam generator. Flow from the TDAFW pump is still available to the other 3 steam
generators. Assuming a single failure in the AFW system, one MDAFW pump would also be operating providing
additional flow to 2 of the steam generators.
In general, for the events analyzed in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) Chapter 15 safety analysis, when
considering the adequacy of the AFW system, it is failure of the 100% capacity TDAFW pump that is taken as the single
failure rather than failure of one of the 50% capacity MDAFW pumps. In this most adverse failure of the AFW system,
the inadvertent closure of 3FWA*HV36A has no impact as AFW is not being delivered from the TDAFW pump.
As an example, the loss of normal feedwater is presented in FSAR Section 15.2.7. The worst single failure in the FSAR
event is the failure of the TDAFW pump, leaving both MDAFW pumps delivering feedwater to all four SGs. Thus, the
inadvertent closure of 3FWA*HV36A will not affect the event as described in the FSAR.
If one postulates a different event than that mentioned in the FSAR, one in which the failure is in one of the MDAFW
pumps rather than the TDAFW pump, using considerations similar to the discussion above, more AFW is inherently
available with one MDAFW pump and the TDAFW pump available for the accident even with the postulated closure of
3FWA*HV36A. While that event will be different than the events presented in the FSAR, it would be less adverse.
The other safety function to be considered is the isolation of AFW flow to a faulted or ruptured “A” steam generator.
Inadvertent closure of 3FWA*HV36A prior to operator action will accomplish this action. It is noted that in all three of
the events, 3FWA*HV36A not only closed on its own, but reopened. The in-series, identical valve 3FWA*HV32A could
be used for control, or if necessary, isolation function.
Despite the inadvertent action of 3FWA*HV36A, both the decay heat removal and steam generator isolation safety
functions would continue to be satisfied.
