On July 22, 2021, with Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 2, operating at 100 percent power, DCPP personnel
determined that since June 30, 2021, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 2-3 would not have been able to attain
Technical Specification (TS) minimum frequency when started in automatic. Manual control of diesel frequency was not
affected. This condition was discovered via a routine surveillance test which evaluates, in part, EDG frequency during
standby and loading conditions.
This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation of the plant in a condition prohibited
by DCPP TS due to the EDG frequency being outside TS required limits for a period beyond the TS required completion
time. This event is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have
prevented fulfillment of a safety function. However, upon discovery, the remaining two of the three EDGs were
operable.
The condition was corrected and the EDG was restored to Operable status on July 22, 2021. A subsequent evaluation
determined that the low frequency condition did not prevent EDG 2-3 from performing its specified safety function.

NARRATIVE
I.(cid:9) Reporting Requirements
This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) and the associated guidance of NUREG-1022,
Revision 3, as an operation or condition prohibited by Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Technical Specifications (TS), due to
the emergency diesel generator (EDG) frequency being outside TS required limits for a period beyond the associated TS
required completion time.
This event is also being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have prevented
fulfillment of a safety function. However, it should be noted that two of the three EDGs were operable at the time of discovery.
II. Plant Conditions
At the time of the event, DCPP Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power.
III. Problem Description
A. Background
DCPP Units 1 and 2 each have three EDGs. The safety function of the EDGs is to provide AC power to Engineered Safety
Features (ESF) loads when offsite power is unavailable. The specified safety functions of EDG 2-3 are:
a. to furnish sufficient power to mitigate a design basis accident in one unit and safely bring DCPP to cold shutdown for
the other unit when both offsite power sources are unavailable.
b. to furnish power sufficient for a controlled shutdown of the plant whenever the main turbine-generator and the offsite
power sources are not available.
To satisfy these functions, the EDG 2-3 must be capable of automatically starting, accelerating to rated speed and voltage in
under 10 seconds and connecting to its respective ESF Bus on detection of Bus undervoltage (UV).
B. Event Description
On July 22, 2021, with DCPP Unit 2, operating at 100 percent power, DCPP personnel determined that since June 30, 2021,
EDG 2-3 would not have been able to attain TS minimum frequency when started in automatic. Manual control of diesel
frequency was not affected.
On July 21, 2021, EDG 2-3 was started on a simulated UV signal for routine surveillance testing. The EDG was started with
the mode select switch in the "AUTO" position which indicates the diesel was aligned for dedicated supply to its associated
4 KV vital electrical Bus. The frequency indicated 58.90 Hz and diesel speed indicated 880 revolutions per minute. Per the
surveillance testing procedure, the frequency should have been between 59.5 Hz and 60.5 Hz (accounting for instrument
uncertainty) on the start prior to any adjustments.
EDG 2-3 was placed in manual, the frequency and speed were adjusted into their proper band, and then the surveillance
test was completed meeting all acceptance criteria. However, due to the frequency attained following the automatic UV
start, EDG 2-3 was declared INOPERABLE.

The low frequency condition discovered during the routine surveillance procedure for EDG 2-3 was below the TS 3.8.1 lower
limit of 59.5 Hz (accounting for instrument uncertainty). This non-conforming condition has been determined to exist between
June 30, 2021 (previous successful EDG 2-3 surveillance) through July 22, 2021 (when restored to Operable status).
A subsequent evaluation determined EDG 2-3 and the equipment powered from its associated vital 4 KV and 480 V Buses
were capable of performing their specified safety functions.
C. Method of Discovery
This condition was discovered via a routine surveillance test which monitors, in part, EDG frequency during standby and
loading conditions.
D. Operator Actions
The condition was corrected and EDG 2-3 was restored to Operable status on July 22, 2021.
F. Safety System Responses
There are no safety system responses associated with this event.
IV. Cause of the Problem
The cause of the EDG 2-3 low frequency condition was due to an inadequately performed post maintenance test. The testing
sequence did not fully consider the need for revalidation of frequency following setting of the EDG governor following
maintenance activities.
V. Assessment of Safety Consequences
There were no safety consequences as a result of this event.
There was no impact on health and safety of the public or plant personnel.
VI. Corrective Actions
The condition was corrected and the EDG was restored to Operable status on July 22, 2021. Follow-up corrective actions to
prevent recurrence will be managed in accordance with the DCPP Corrective Action Program.
VII. Additional Information
There have been no similar events for the EDGs at DCPP in the previous three years.
