On January 06, 2022, with both units operating at 100% power, the South Texas Project 345 kV south
switchyard electrical bus unexpectedly de-energized. The de-energization of the south bus resulted in a loss
of power to the Unit 2 standby transformer which was supplying power to the Engineered Safety Features
(ESF) 4160V busses for the Unit 2 B Train. The associated Emergency Diesel Generator 22 automatically
started in response to the undervoltage condition, as designed.
The cause of this event was an electrical flashover on a Transmission Distribution Service Provider owned
insulator on the south bus. This event is reportable as an event which resulted in the automatic actuation
of the Unit 2 emergency AC electrical power systems. Corrective actions included replacing the insulator,
performing inspections for abnormal electrical Corona on the insulators (no adverse values were found), and
cleaning of the other insulators on the North and South bus. There were no previous indications of issues with
the insulator.
The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates and there
were no personnel injuries or damage to any safety-related equipment associated with this event. Additionally,
all ESF equipment operated as designed. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety
of the public.

NARRATIVE
I. Description of Reportable Event
A. Reportable event classification
This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in the valid
actuation of an emergency AC electrical power system (50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(8)).
B. Plant operating conditions prior to event
Prior to the event on January 6, 2022, STP Unit 2 was at 100% power in Mode 1.
C. Status of structures, systems, and components that were inoperable at the start of the event and that
contributed to the event
No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to
this event.
D. Background information
The Offsite Electrical System consists of two standby transformers, the 138 kV emergency transformer,
two main power transformers, 345 kV lines connecting the main power transformers and the standby
transformers to the switchyard, the 345 kV switchyard, nine 345 kV transmission circuits from the South
Texas Project Electric Generating Station (STPEGS) 345 kV switchyard to the interconnecting grids,
and the 138 kV radial line connected to the 138 kV emergency transformer. The transmission system
provides reliable sources of offsite power for supplying plant auxiliary power systems for plant startup,
shutdown or at any time that power is unavailable from the unit's main generator.
The standby transformers are individually supplied by separate and independent overhead 345 kV ties
from the 345 kV switchyard, one from the south bus and one from the north bus. Each standby
transformer normally supplies B Train Engineered Safety Features (ESF) busses in each unit. The ESF
busses in each unit can be aligned to be powered from either the Unit 1 or the Unit 2 standby transformer.
Per STP Technical Specification (T.S.) 3.8.1.1.e, with two of the above required offsite A.C. circuits
inoperable, within 24 hours restore at least one of the inoperable offsite sources to OPERABLE status
or apply the requirements of the Configuration Risk Management Program (CRMP) or be in at least HOT
STANDBY within the next 6 hours. Unit 2 entered T.S. Action 3.8.1.1.e. in response to this event.
E. Narrative summary of the event
On January 06, 2022, at 06:03 with both units operating at 100% power, a south bus lockout
occurred that caused an engineered safety system to actuate and momentarily de-energize the
bus to clear the fault. The 345kV was automatically restored successfully. This momentary loss of
the 345 kV south bus in the switchyard caused the Unit 2 ESF bus to lockout and transfer to the
ESF Unit 2 Train B Standby Diesel Generator 22 as designed. The control room received reports
of a visible flash observed in the switchyard at 06:10. A second event at 07:43 of a clear flashover
was observed by onsite Transmission Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) personnel. The south
bus auto de-energized both times as designed to clear a fault. After the second event, the TDSP

took down the bus manually to al ow for maintenance and the Unit 2 standby transformer was
declared inoperable. STP and TDSP personnel quickly identified the TDSP owned insulator and
gathered necessary parts for replacement. The loss of the Unit 2 standby transformer caused an
automatic bus trip of the Unit 2 13 Train 4.16KV bus, the automatic start of the Unit 2 Train B
Standby Diesel Generator 22 and the automatic sequenced loading of ESF equipment. During
this event Unit 2 stayed at 100% power. At 10:44, the off-site power was restored to Unit 2
4.16KV bus via the Unit 2 standby transformer. The insulator on the South Bus was replaced,
other insulators were cleaned, and a normal power configuration was established at 22:27 on
January 06, 2022.

F. Method of discovery
This event was self-revealed when a bus lockout in the switchyard caused the loss of a credited off-site
electrical power source. This resulted in the automatic actuation of on-site emergency power sources.
A second flashover was observed by a TDSP employee.
II. Component failures
A. Failure Mode, mechanism, and effects of failed component
The failure mode was an insulator electrical arch flash that caused a phase-to-ground short. The protective
relay detected the fault and cycled the breaker which momentarily removed all voltage from the bus to
isolate the south bus from the fault.
B. Cause of component or system failure or personnel error
A flashover occurred when an electrical arch flashed along the top side of a TDSP owned insulator from
the bus to the insulator support, effectively grounding the A phase of the south bus.
C. Systems or secondary functions that were affected by the failure of components with multiple functions
The de-energization of the south bus disconnected Unit 2 standby transformer from the grid. Since this
transformer is the normal supply to Unit 2 B Train ESF bus, the resulting undervoltage condition initiated
a loss of offsite power (LOOP) signal, which sent a valid actuation signal to the Unit 2 Train B Standby
Diesel Generator 22.
D. Failed component information
• System: { FK } (Switchyard - TSDP owned equipment)
• Component: { INS }
• Manufacturer: LAPP {LAPP}
• Model: {34618-1} {24812-2}
III. Analysis of the event
A. Safety system responses that occurred
The loss of the Unit 2 standby transformer caused an automatic bus trip of the Unit 2 B Train 4.16KV bus,
the automatic start of the Unit 2 Train B Standby Diesel Generator 22 and the automatic sequenced loading
of ESF equipment.
B. Duration of safety system inoperability
When the south bus was de-energized, Unit 2 entered T.S. Action 3.8.1.1.e on January 6, 2022, at 06:03
hours due to two independent offsite circuits being inoperable — the switchyard south bus and ESF bus
E2B were not connected to their offsite source. Upon re-energization of ESF Bus E2B at 10:22 hours
(4 hours and 19 minutes later), Unit 2 exited T.S. Action 3.8.1.1.e and entered T.S. Action 3.8.1.1.a due
to one independent offsite circuit being inoperable. Unit 2 exited T.S. Action 3.8.1.1.a at 22:27 hours

(12 hours and 05 minutes later) when the offsite circuits were declared operable following the restoration
of the switchyard south bus and Unit 2 standby transformer. Therefore, the total safety system inoperability
duration was 16 hours and 24 minutes.
C. Safety consequences and implications
This event resulted in the actuation of the Unit 2 emergency AC electrical power system. This event did not
result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates, and there were no personnel
injuries or damage to other safety-related equipment. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health
and safety of the public.
IV. Cause of the event
The cause of the event was due to arch flash across a TDSP owned insulator which resulted in a phase-
to-ground fault and subsequent bus lock out. There were no previous indications of issues with the insulator.
V. Corrective actions
1. The insulator that experienced the flash was replaced.
2. Corona effect inspections were performed on insulators before and after cleaning (no adverse values
were found).
3. Other insulators on the North and South Bus were cleaned.
4. Equipment was restored as required by plant conditions.
5. Applicable T.S. Action statements were met.
VI. Previous similar events
A review of internal operating experience identified no similar events at STP.
