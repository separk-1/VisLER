Since the reactor trip breakers were already open, the procedurally directed reactor trip was an unnecessary RPS actuation. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to manual actuation of the RPS. There were no safety consequences due to this event. When the reactor was manually tripped, the reactor trip breakers were already in an open state, there was no irradiated fuel in the core, and there was no decay heat present. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Procedure 3-AOP-202, "Condensate System Malfunctions," was revised to require checking reactor trip breakers are not open prior to manually tripping the reactor when responding to gland steam pressure below the AOP's established limit.

DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A. EVENT On 10/4/21 during a shutdown for the 2021 Refueling Outage, following the planned reactor trip, Reactor Coolant Average Temperature (Tavg) lowered due to overfeeding the 'B' Steam Generator (S/G). To maintain Tavg, feed to the S/Gs was minimized. During the cooldown, 'A' S/G lowered and resulted in an unplanned entry into LCO 3.4.5, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Loops - MODES 1, </=8.5% rated thermal power (RTP), 2, and 3. As S/G Level lowered, a valid Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) actuation signal was generated. The 'A' Train AFW System was already in service and aligned when the actuation signal was generated. No equipment position changes were noted as a result of the actuation, which is the expected response for the given plant conditions.

Feedwater was secured to the S/Gs; however, Tavg lowered and stabilized at approximately 535 degrees. During this time the ‘B’ Main Feedwater Pump was secured so AFW flow could be established and was subsequently minimized to reduce the cooldown effects on Tavg. ‘A’ S/G level lowered to 6% and the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) were closed to limit secondary side steam flows and raise Tavg. After closing the MSIVs, Tavg stabilized at approximately 547 degrees and ‘A’ S/G level was restored to approximately 52%. B.

                <div class="text-content">EVENT DESCRIPTION On 10/9/21, while Unit 3 was in Mode 3 during a planned shutdown to commence the Cycle 32 refueling outage, with the 3B Steam Generator Feedwater Pump (SGFP) [SJ, P] in service, high level in the 3A Steam Generator (S/G) [SJ, SG] caused a feedwater isolation signal that tripped the 3B SGFP. The AFW [BA] system automatically actuated as designed in response to the trip of the last running SGFP. Since Unit 3 was in Mode 3 and reactor subcritical, feedwater supply to the S/Gs was aligned through the bypass feedwater flow control valves [SJ, FCV], with the 3B SGFP in operation. The 3A S/G main feedwater regulating valve FCV-3-478 [SJ, FCV] and the upstream motor-operated isolation valve MOV-3-1407 [SJ, 20] were fully closed. The bypass flow control valves were maintained in manual control as directed by the operating procedure. In response to a gradually increasing level trend in the 3A S/G that was initially identified at approximately 02:40am, adjustments were made to the 3A feedwater bypass flow control valve FCV-3-479 to reduce feedwater flow to the 3A S/G. By 02:50am, the feedwater bypass flow control valve was fully closed and feedwater flow and 3A S/G level continued to increase. At 02:54am the feedwater bypass isolation valve POV-3-477 [SJ, ISV] was fully closed to ensure that 3A S/G feedwater flow was positively secured through the bypass line. Feedwater flow and 3A S/G level continued to increase. At 02:56am level in the 3A S/G reached 80% narrow range, initiating a feedwater isolation signal that tripped the 3B SGFP. AFW automatically actuated in response to the trip of the last running SGFP. All systems responded as designed to the elevated level condition in the 3A S/G. The AFW system was subsequently secured and plant cooldown was continued in accordance with operating procedures. CAUSE The cause of the increasing level trend in the 3A S/G was seat leakage past the 3A S/G main feedwater regulating valve FCV-3-478 and upstream isolation valve MOV-3-1407. FCV-3-478 was overhauled. The plug, seat adapter, and seals were found degraded, consistent with extended service wear. The normal overhaul PM frequency for the feedwater regulating valves is every 4 refueling outages; however, the frequency for FCV-3-478 had been one-time extended to a 5th outage the previous cycle. The remaining feedwater regulating valves have remained on a 4-outage overhaul PM frequency. To support its primary function of feedwater isolation (no SGFP in operation), MOV-3-1407 closing torque is set up for condensate pump discharge pressure, which yields a significantly lower differential pressure across the valve seat than SGFP discharge pressure. This can result in the seating surface being less than fully sealed during normal Mode 3 operation when a SGFP is in service. Thus, seat leakage past MOV-3-1407 is expected given the deficiencies identified with FCV-3-478. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE This safety significance of this event was low. All systems and equipment operated as designed in response to high level in the 3A S/G. Reactor Coolant System cooldown remained within procedural limits.</div>

                <div class="text-content">Plant Operating Conditions Prior to the Event Both units operating at 100% 1.0 Description of Event The non-essential Service Water (SW) automatic isolation function [EMS: JE, KG] ensures adequate intake canal inventory can be maintained by the emergency service water pumps [EllS: BI, P] following a design basis loss of coolant accident (LOCA) with a coincident loss of offsite power (LOOP). This function is designed to actuate when any three of the four intake canal level probes [EIIS: JE, LE] sense water level drop from the normal 28-foot level past a fixed level point of 23.5 feet. The probes are required to actuate in 55 seconds or less to ensure that the automatic logic initiates prior to the intake canal level dropping to 23 feet under all design basis scenarios. The 23-foot level is the initial condition used in the accident analyses. The four (4) intake canal level probes are routinely cleaned and inspected from April to October. This is based on the typical period that the colonial hydroids grow in the service water system, plus some buffer time on either side of that time range. Typically, the probes are found clean during the April and May cleanings and found clean in the September and October cleanings. Although there is some variance from year to year, in general, this cleaning period has worked best for the discovery and removal of colonial hydroids. On 3/22/2022, the 18-month channel 1 and channel 4 [EMS: JE, CHA] intake canal level probe calibrations were both scheduled. They were scheduled and performed sequentially. Both probes had been installed approximately 18 months earlier (channel 1 on 7/10/2020 and channel 4 on 7/15/2020).

                <div class="text-content">EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 26, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP), Units 1 and Unit 2, were both in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at 100 percent power. The total Cooling Water (CL) system operating flow rates were in the range that operation of only one CL pump was desired. Non-safety related train B 21 CL Pump was supporting all the CL system loads for both trains of CL while the train B 22 Diesel Driven Cooling Water Pump (DDCLP) was out of service for maintenance and the 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) was aligned as the train B replacement safety- related pump. At 1044 CST, the train A 12 DDCLP auto started on a sensed low header pressure following the isolation of 22 Cooling Water Strainer for maintenance and subsequent auto initiation of backwash of the other Cooling Water Strainers which reduced system pressure slightly. <span class="highlight highlight-Procedure_or_Regulation" data-details='{"extraction_class": "Procedure_or_Regulation", "extraction_text": "The 12 DDCLP is designed to start automatically if the CL discharge header pressure drops to 75 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for 15 seconds.", "attributes": {"status": "design specification"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 872, "end_pos": 1019}}' title="Procedure_or_Regulation">The 12 DDCLP is designed to start automatically if the CL discharge header pressure drops to 75 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for 15 seconds.</span><span class="highlight highlight-Condition" data-details='{"extraction_class": "Condition", "extraction_text": "CL discharge header pressure drops to 75 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for 15 seconds", "attributes": {"trigger": "automatic start"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 927, "end_pos": 1018}}' title="Condition">CL discharge header pressure drops to 75 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for 15 seconds</span>.

EVENT ANALYSIS The 12 DDCLP is a part of the PINGP CL System (EIIS CODE: BI). The CL system is a ring header which is shared by Units 1 and 2 that provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operational heat from safety-related components during a design basis accident or transient. During normal and shutdown operation, the CL system also provides this function for various safety-related and non-safety related components. The CL system consists of a common CL pump discharge header for five CL pumps: two non-safety related pumps, two safety related DDCLPs, and 121 MDCLP that can be aligned as replacement for either DDCLP by realigning its power supply and administratively disabling the CL pump discharge header valves to direct flow to the appropriate train.

                <div class="text-content">Plant Operating Conditions Prior to the Event: Unit 1 - Mode 1, 100 percent Power Unit 2 - Defueled EVENT DESCRIPTION At 11:10 on October 19, 2023, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) Unit 1 operating at 100 percent power and Unit 2 defueled in a scheduled refueling outage, multiple substation breakers, including the Unit 1 generator output breaker, unexpectedly opened causing a Unit 1 Turbine [TA] Trip and subsequent Reactor Trip. In addition, multiple grounds were detected on DC control cabling for both Units from the plant to the substation control house. The Turbine Trip caused 1M Main Transformer to become deenergized, which is the normal power supply to non-safety related (NSR) busses on Unit 1. 1R Auxiliary Transformer was also deenergized as a result of the event and therefore was not available for a Fast Bus Transfer, which resulted in a loss of all NSR busses on both Units. The reactor trip resulted in Steam Generator Water Level (SGWL) in both Steam Generators rapidly shrinking to below the setpoint for an automatic start of both Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[BA] pumps. These pumps ensure that at least one Steam Generator contains enough water to serve as the heat sink for reactor decay heat and sensible heat removal following a reactor trip. Both the 11 Turbine Driven AFW Pump and 12 Motor Driven AFW Pump actuated upon reaching the automatic start setpoint for low SGWL. The 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) auto started on low header pressure due to the loss of the NSR 11 Cooling Water (CL) Pump. The 121 MDCLP is designed to start automatically if CL header pressure drops to 80 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The 121 MDCLP is a part of the PINGP Cooling Water (CL) System [BI]. The CL system is a ring header which is shared by Units 1 and 2 that provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operational heat from safety-related components during a design basis accident or transient.

                <div class="text-content">I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at approximately 15 percent rated thermal power. II. Description of Event A.  Event Summary: On October 28, 2021, Main Steam [EIIS: SB] Throttle Valve-1 (TV-1) [EIIS: SCV], associated with the high-pressure turbine [EIIS: TRB] and turbine trip [EMS: JJ] function, was replaced during the Unit 2 refueling outage. On November 5, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 (Verify ESFAS [Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System] RESPONSE TIMES are within limit) was successfully completed for the Turbine Trip function. On November 8, at 2115 eastern standard time (EST), during turbine overspeed trip testing, it was identified that TV-1 took longer than expected to close on the overspeed trip signal. During subsequent testing, TV-1 continued to close slower than expected. In response, station personnel developed a support/refute matrix that included validating installation of an orifice block vice a flushing block in TV-1. This led to the discovery that TV-1 was installed with the incorrect block. The flushing block was replaced with the correct orifice block. On November 9, at 0700, SR 3.3.2.9 was successfully completed restoring the valve to operable status. At 0745 a partial performance of turbine overspeed testing confirmed TV-1 was functioning as required. During the Unit 2 refueling outage, TV-1 was one of several turbine control system valves replaced. Valves received from the vendor typically arrive with flushing blocks installed and are clearly labeled as such. Two of the replacement valves were received with labeled flushing blocks attached. TV-1 was received from the vendor without a labeled flushing block that appeared to be and was assumed to be the required orifice block for the valve. Total reliance was placed on the vendor method for labeling flushing blocks. The delta in closing times between the November 5th ESFAS testing and the November 8th turbine overspeed testing is most probably the result of different system alignments during the tests. During the performance of ESFAS testing, the four main steam throttle valves are manipulated with the governor valves remaining closed and isolated from the Electrohydraulic Control (EHC) System. Whereas, during the performance of turbine overspeed trip testing, all the throttle valves and governor valves are manipulated. It is possible that additional flow in the EHC trip header, due to flow from the additional valves, could cause increased backpressure on the throttle drain to the trip header. With the flushing block installed on TV-1 rather than the required orifice, it is possible the backpressure on TV-1 could reduce the effectiveness of draining EH fluid to the trip header. This reduced flow would in turn slow the response of TV-1 to close. A condition report (CR) was initiated to evaluate if the system</div>

                <div class="text-content">EVENT DESCRIPTION On February 1, 2023, at 0956 CST, while Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, maintenance was conducting troubleshooting to identify the source of an Auxilliary Building (AB) "B" Train DC ground. The ground was identified to be on the negative side of the AB Battery [EIIS / EEIS : EJ / BTRY]. When portable ground detection equipment (DC Scout) was connected to the positive terminal of the AB Battery a loss of Electro Hydraulic Control (EHC) [EIIS: TG] oil pressure occurred which resulted in a turbine trip and subsequent reactor trip. During the forced outage it was determined that the DC ground existed on a cable between the AB and Turbine Building associated with the Turbine Trip Solenoid Valve (20-ET) [EIIS / EEIS: TG / SOL]. The 20-ET solenoid valve is normally closed and energizes to open to dump EHC oil from the turbine throttle valves and governor valves. It was confirmed via troubleshooting that when maintenance connected the DC Scout to the AB Battery terminal it created a jumper in the circuit to energize the 20-ET solenoid. During the plant trip <span class="highlight highlight-Outcome" data-details='{"extraction_class": "Outcome", "extraction_text": "the \"1A\" 4 kV non emergency bus [EIIS : EA] failed to transfer to the \"1A\" 4 kV Startup Transformer [EIIS : EB]", "attributes": {"consequence": "trip of the \"A\" Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP)"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 1132, "end_pos": 1242}}' title="Outcome">the "1A" 4 kV non emergency bus [EIIS : EA] failed to transfer to the "1A" 4 kV Startup Transformer [EIIS : EB]</span>]. This resulted in the trip of the "A" Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) [EIIS / EEIS: AB / P]. The "B" and "C" RCPs remained in operation. Additionally, Auxilliary Feedwater System (AFW) [EIIS: BA] autostarted as expected post reactor trip and maintained feedwater flow to the Steam Generators (EIIS: SB). Main Feed Water (MAW) [EIIS: SJ] and the condenser [EIIS: SG] remained available for post trip decay heat removal.

Bus 1DB powers one of the two sets of redundant ESF equipment needed in the postulated design basis accident (DBA) scenario. In the event neither EDG is available to power its respective loads, a non-safety related alternate AC power (AAC) source can provide power. The AAC is designed to provide back-up power to either ESF bus whenever one of the EDGs is out of service, particularly in Modes 1 through 4 operation. The design of the AAC is capable of providing the required safety and non- safety related loads in the event of a total loss of offsite power and if both EDGs fail to start and load. Although the AAC is not designed for DBA loads, it is capable of supplying sufficient power to mitigate the effects of an accident. The AAC is not credited in the safety analysis.</div>

                <span>Event Date:</span> 04-29-2022<br>

                <div class="text-content">Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets []. A. Background Prior to the event, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the time of this event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as “Any event or condition that resulted in manual actuation or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of [10 CFR 50.73]...” due to actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JC] and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) [BA]. All actuated safety systems functioned as designed. The Main Condenser Air Removal System [SH] vacuum pumps (CVPs) [P] are designed to establish and maintain condenser vacuum and to remove non-condensable gases during plant operation. Condenser vacuum is normally maintained at approximately 2 to 4 inches of mercury (Hg) absolute to minimize condenser back pressure. Operating with high back pressure may cause overheating of the turbine [TRB] elements, which could lead to distortion of the rotor and/or turbine blading. There are two 100 percent capacity two-stage liquid ring type CVPs that require seal water to function. The seal water provides inlet spray at the inlet of the pump first stage which condenses vapors before they enter the main pump body. Airflow passes from the compression stages into the moisture separator [SEP] tank [TK]. The moisture separator tank allows the air to separate from the water in the discharge of the CVPs. Air is discharged to the Turbine Building vent stack. The water remains in the moisture separator tank and serves as a reservoir for the seal water supply. Each CVP has an air-operated suction valve [ISV] that isolates the CVPs from the condenser. Each of the suction valves will open with the start of the associated CVP and will close when the CVP is secured. There is a check valve [V] on the outlet of each moisture separator tank that prevents reverse flow when the CVP is shut down. This check valve provides a backup to the CVP suction valve to prevent reverse flow through the moisture separator tank and CVP. The air-operated suction valve is an air-to-open, spring-to-close butterfly valve with a piston actuator. The air supplied to the valve actuator is controlled by a solenoid-operated valve (SOV) [SOL]. When the CVP is in operation, the SOV is energized and supplying air to the actuator that opens the valve to provide a path to the condenser for drawing a vacuum. When the CVP is off, the SOV is de-energized, which vents the air from the actuator, allowing the actuator spring to close the valve. B.

                <div class="text-content">Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND The Main Feedwater Pump Recirculation Valves (2FWR-FCV150A and B) [JB] are each controlled by a CLOSE-AUTO- OPEN key switch located in the field near the valve. The key switch is normally maintained in AUTO to allow the valves to be controlled by flow switches in the suction line of the main feed pumps. Red (open) and Green (closed) indicating lights are provided on Benchboard Section C. The valve will manually open when its local control switch is placed in OPEN and will manually close when its local control switch is placed in CLOSE. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT At 1007 EST on November 12, 2021, the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit 2 (BVPS-2) reactor was manually tripped due to increasing steam generator [SB] water levels due to 2FWR-FCV150A and B oscillating. The oscillation of the valves led to a steam generator water level transient that met predefined reactor trip criteria. BVPS-2 was in Mode 1 at approximately 17 percent power following a refueling outage and no equipment was inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. The trip was not complicated, and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3. Prior to the event, at approximately 0040, a procedure step to verify that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were in OPEN was not performed, resulting in the key lock switches being left in AUTO. Reactor power was then raised from 5 percent over the next hour and a half to approximately 17 percent by 0200. A condenser steam dump/turbine bypass valve perturbation caused 2FWR-FCV150A and B to oscillate and then stabilize at approximately 0630. At approximately 0945 the valves began oscillating again resulting in steam generator water level increase, and the bypass feedwater regulating valves were placed in manual control to control the steam generator water level. At 1000, the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were placed in OPEN. The steam generator water levels reached the trip criteria before they were able to be stabilized and the plant was manually tripped at 1007. CAUSE OF EVENT On midnight shift during the performance of 2OM-52.4.A, "Raising Power From 5% to Full Load Operation," revision 90, a step to verify that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were in the OPEN position was not performed properly, resulting in the key lock switches being left in AUTO. During turbine valve testing on the following shift, a condenser steam dump [JI] oscillation occurred that led to feedwater flow being lowered to the setpoint of 2FWR- FCV150A and B which caused the valves to oscillate. These oscillations led to the steam generator water level transient and subsequent manual reactor trip. The direct cause was that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were left in AUTO allowing the valves to modulate based on flow indication.</div>

BACKGROUND The heater drain pumps and separator drain receiver drain pumps along with the condensate pumps provide flow at sufficient pressure to the suction of the Main Feedwater Pumps (MFPs).

A third standby condensate pump provides redundancy for any MFP suction flow transients that could challenge MFP operation and is normally aligned to auto-start on low MFP suction pressure.

Condition B for one EDG inoperable requires a surveillance to be performed for the operable offsite circuit(s) within 1 hour and then once every 8 hours, as well as restoration of the EDG to operable status within 72 hours. Additionally, TS 3.8.1 condition E with two EDGs inoperable requires one to be restored to operable status within 2 hours. Condition G requires shutdown of the Unit if the Required Action and Completion Time are not met. The EDG fuel oil injection pumps [DC-P] have a gravity drain to the underground fuel oil storage tank [DE-TK] which allows excess fuel oil from the pumps to return to the tank. This is routed such that there is an inverted U-shaped section of the piping which can trap air if drained. A normally closed vent valve is located on this section of pipe to release any trapped air.

                <div class="text-content">Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND The Steam Generator Feedwater System (FWS) [SJ] supplies heated feedwater to the steam generators [SG] under all load conditions maintaining level within the programmed band. Two 50 percent capacity motor-driven Main Feedwater Pumps (MFPs) [SJ-P], 2FWS-P21A and 2FWS-P216, supply sufficient feedwater flow to the three steam generators for full power operation. Each MFP has a lube oil (LO) system which consists of a reservoir, a shaft-driven pump, an auxiliary motor-driven pump, a relief valve, an oil cooler, and the necessary piping, valves and instrumentation. Oil is normally supplied by the shaft-driven LO pump. The auxiliary motor-driven LO pump provides lubrication requirements during startup and as a backup to the shaft-driven pump. The LO system relief valve [SJ-RV] maintains the LO system operating pressure. The MFP start circuit requires sufficient LO pressure to enable the start permissive to be met when starting a MFP. On a 'Loss of both Main Feedwater Pump(s)' signal, the Motor Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (MDAFW) Pumps [BA-P] auto start to provide feedwater flow to the steam generators to remove decay heat from the Reactor Coolant System [AB].

When opening the door during Modes 1-4, 1/2-ADM-2021, revision 15 required that the work group is briefed to close the door at the end of the work period and a Narrative Log entry is made stating that equipment required to close the door is staged and identifies the responsible work group. In the event of a tornado watch, the Shift Manager is required to direct the work group to close and secure the door. When the door is closed, the responsible work group is required to report the closure to the control room and a Narrative Log entry is made stating that the door is shut. When opening the door during Mode 5, the Narrative Log entry also states that the door shall be shut and latched prior to entry into Mode 4. Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.7 requires two trains of CCP to be operable in Modes 1-4. With one train inoperable, Condition A requires the CCP train to be restored to operable status within 72 hours or the unit must go to Mode 3 in 6 hours and Mode 5 in 36 hours.

BACKGROUND Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) has a Train ‘A’ and a Train ‘B’ Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) [EK] to power their respective emergency buses and associated Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) Systems. The redundant trains ensure the minimum safety functions will be performed with either EDG Operable. The EDG Lube Oil (LO) System [LA] provides lubrication to the main bearings, crank pins, camshaft bearing, and other oil- lubricated wearing parts within the EDG. The EDG LO System also includes a Rocker Arm LO System that provides lubrication for the rocker arms and valve gear while the EDG is operating. The Rocker Arm LO reservoir level is maintained by the EDG LO System through a level control valve. Leakage from the Fuel Oil System [DC] injectors or fuel oil line connections may cause fuel oil to contaminate the Rocker Arm LO System.

This LO sample had been obtained on June 28, 2023, and was a step change from the 1.9 percent concentration identified in a previous sample obtained on April 19, 2023. With a calculated leak rate of 0.082 percent / hour, the 2-2 EDG would have been capable of operating for approximately 3.13 days until the <span class="highlight highlight-Condition" data-details='{"extraction_class": "Condition", "extraction_text": "maximum calculated dilution of 6.17 percent was met", "attributes": {"trigger": "calculated leak rate of 0.082 percent / hour"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 2187, "end_pos": 2238}}' title="Condition">maximum calculated dilution of 6.17 percent was met</span>.

No observable leakage was found during troubleshooting to identify the source of leakage. However, <span class="highlight highlight-Cause" data-details='{"extraction_class": "Cause", "extraction_text": "the fuel injection line packing nut on cylinder No. 11 was found loose", "attributes": {"category": "not_applicable"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 2486, "end_pos": 2556}}' title="Cause">the fuel injection line packing nut on cylinder No. 11 was found loose</span><span class="highlight highlight-CorrectiveAction" data-details='{"extraction_class": "CorrectiveAction", "extraction_text": "the fuel injection line packing nut on cylinder No. 11 was found loose and tightened two revolutions", "attributes": {"action_type": "repair"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 2486, "end_pos": 2586}}' title="CorrectiveAction">the fuel injection line packing nut on cylinder No. 11 was found loose and tightened two revolutions</span>. LO samples were taken during the subsequent nine-hour 2-2 EDG maintenance run completed on July 14, 2023. Based on the LO sample test results, it is indeterminate if the leak had been repaired or if residual fuel oil remained present in the LO system during the EDG run.</div>

Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets. Catawba unique system and component identifiers are contained within parentheses. This event is being reported under the following criterion: 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), for any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of the reactor protection system and the PWR auxiliary feedwater system. Rod Control System [JD](IRE): The IRE system provides for reactor power modulation by manual or automatic control of full length control rod banks in a pre-selected sequence and for manual operation of individual banks. Alarms are provided to alert the operator in the event of a control rod deviation exceeding a preset limit. Reactor Protection System [JC](IPE): The Reactor Trip System automatically limits reactor operation to within a safe region by shutting down the reactor whenever the limits of the region are approached. The safe operating region is defined by several considerations such as mechanical/hydraulic limitations on equipment and heat transfer phenomena. Therefore, the Reactor Trip System keeps surveillance on process variables which are directly related to equipment mechanical limitations, such as pressure, pressurizer water level, and on variables which directly affect the heat transfer capability of the reactor. Other parameters utilized in the IPE system are calculated from various process variables. Whenever a direct process or calculated variable exceeds a setpoint, the reactor will be shut down in order to protect against either gross damage to fuel cladding or loss of system integrity, which could lead to release of radioactive fission products into the Containment. The various reactor trip circuits automatically open the reactor trip breakers whenever a condition monitored by the IPE system reaches a preset level. Station operators may elect to actuate the reactor trip switchgear manually (manual reactor trip) using either of two control board switches. The manual trip consists of two switches, one for train A and one for train B, in the control room. Operating a manual trip switch removes the voltage from the corresponding undervoltage trip coil and energizes the shunt coil while actuating the associated Reactor Trip Breaker.</div>

Catawba Nuclear Station unique system and component identifiers are contained within parentheses. This event is being reported under the following criterion: 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)." The applicable 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B) systems include the Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System. Reactor Protection System [JC] (IPE) The Reactor Trip System automatically limits reactor operation to within a safe region by shutting down the reactor whenever the limits of the region are approached. Whenever a direct process or calculated variable exceeds a setpoint the reactor will be shutdown in order to protect against either gross damage to fuel cladding or loss of system integrity which could lead to release of radioactive fission products into the containment. The various reactor trip circuits automatically open the reactor trip breakers whenever a condition monitored by the Reactor Trip System reaches a preset level. In addition to the automatic monitoring and actuation of the protection system, a manual actuation circuit is also available to initiate a reactor shutdown. The manual trip consists of two switches (one for Train A and one for train B) in the control room. There are no interlocks that can block this trip. Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA] (CA) The Auxiliary Feedwater System is the assured source of feedwater to the steam generators during accident conditions. The CA System is designed to start automatically in the event of loss of offsite electrical power, trip of both main feedwater pumps, safety injection signal, or low-low steam generator water level; any of which may result in, coincide with, or be caused by a reactor trip. The CA System will supply sufficient feedwater to maintain the reactor at hot standby for two hours followed by cooldown of the Reactor Coolant System to the temperature at which the Residual Heat Removal System may be operated. Condenser Circulating Water [KE] (RC) The Condenser Circulating Water System supplies cooling water to the main and feedwater pump turbine condensers to condense the turbine exhaust steam. The rejected heat from the condensers is dissipated to the ambient surroundings by the cooling towers while meeting all applicable chemical and thermal effluent criteria.</div>

                <div class="text-content">1. EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the 'B' train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 3HVR*FN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. This fan provides a support function for the Charging Pumps and RPCCW Pumps, as well as supporting operation of the Auxiliary Building Filter system and Supplemental Leak Collection and Release System (SLCRS). As a result of the fan tripping, Operations personnel entered the following Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS): • TSAS 3.5.2.a for one Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) subsystem inoperable, which requires the inoperable subsystem to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 6 hours. • TSAS 3.7.3 for one RPCCW safety loop inoperable, which requires the inoperable safety loop to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the following 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. • TSAS 3.6.6.1 for one SLCRS system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. • TSAS 3.7.9 for one Auxiliary Building Filter system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. Millstone Maintenance inspected the fan and found that the motor shaft was bent, causing the fan blades to contact the housing. After the failure was identified, repair activities proceeded on a continuous basis with the goal of completing the repairs and validating operability of the fan prior to expiration of the 72-hour Allowed Outage time (AOT) of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. However, as corrective maintenance activities to replace the fan motor and fan hub assembly progressed, completion of the repairs was forecasted to extend beyond the original 72-hour AOT. Therefore, on January 26, 2022, at approximately 0830 hours, Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut (DENC) informed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of the need for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) from the requirements of TS 3.5.2 and 3.7.3 for a period of 72 hours to avoid an unnecessary shutdown while repairs were completed. The NOED request was verbally approved by the NRC on January 26, 2022, at approximately 1034 hours. On January 27, 2022, at 2050 hours, corrective maintenance and post-maintenance testing of the fan was completed satisfactorily, the TSASs were exited, and the period of Notice Of Enforcement Discretion exited. One ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes, which exceeds the 72-hour AOT of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. Therefore, this event is being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. 2. CAUSE Investigation has determined that the fan failure was caused by a motor bearing failure. The failed bearing is manufactured by FAFNIR and its model number is 314KDD BEARING.</div>

                <div class="text-content">On October 6, 2022 at 1300 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, ultrasonic testing (UT) measurement on “A” train residual heat removal (RHR) piping identified a gas void greater than the acceptance criteria. The UT measurement was taken during monthly performance of SP 3610A.3, “RHR System Vent and Valve  Lineup Verification” on the “A” low pressure safety injection to charging pump suction line, 3-SIL-008-14-2, at Point 10. The “A” train of RHR was declared inoperable and Technical Specifications (TS) 3.5.2, Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) was entered. Venting was performed and the ECCS system was declared operable in accordance with SP 3610A.3 on October 6, 2022 at 1725 hours and TS 3.5.2 was exited. On October 14, 2022, SP3610A.3 was performed at point 10 and a gas void greater than acceptance criteria was observed in the line 3-SIL-008-14-2. “A” train of RHR was declared inoperable, and TS 3.5.2 was entered on October 14, 2022, at 1005 hours. Point 10 was vented and a UT was performed and confirmed that the piping was 100% full of water. TS 3.5.2 was exited on October 14, 2022, at 1737 hours. Troubleshooting was performed on October 15, 2022 to fully characterize the gas void in line 3-SIL-008-14-2. To support this troubleshooting, TS 3.5.2 was entered and “A” train of RHR was declared inoperable on October 15, 2022 at 0944 hours. This line was divided into 10 sections and full expanded ultrasonic testing measurements were taken at each section. Repeated venting and agitation of the line was performed to remove the gas voids. After the initial expanded UT characterization, it was concluded that the remaining gas void volume was greater than the acceptable gas void volume. After repeated venting and agitation evolutions, the final UT characterization determined that the gas void volume was less than acceptable limits. An operability determination evaluated the  as-left condition and determined that “A” train of RHR was able to perform its design function. The ECCS system was declared operable and TS 3.5.2 was exited on October 17, 2022 at 1441 hours. On August 31, 2023, an NRC inspector identified a non-conservative error within the void volume calculation 14-ENG-04518M3 “MP3 GL2008-01 Pump Suction Side Gas Void Allowable Volume Using Westinghouse Simplified Equation Method” approved in 2015. Millstone engineering determined that the pressure used for evaluating a void volume in line 3-SIL-008-014-2 was incorrect and non-conservative. This error resulted in the reduction of the allowable void size acceptance criteria. Based on the corrected acceptable void volume, the original as-found gas void volume identified on October 6, 2022, was greater than the allowable acceptable gas void volume; therefore, the plant was operating in a condition outside of plant Technical Specifications. Void volume greater than acceptable limits existed from May 18, 2022, when the plant entered Mode 3, until October 17, 2022 when void volume was verified to be less than acceptable limits. SP 3610A.3 is performed monthly and the line 3-SIL-008-014-2 was verified to be full of water each month from the refueling outage until its performance on October 6, 2022. Prior to October 17, 2022, the procedure SP 3610A.3 directed that a single UT measurement to be taken at Point 10 on line 3-SIL-008-14-2 to measure the gas void volume. This did not fully characterize the void volume in line 3-SIL-008-14-2. The procedure SP 3610A.3 has been revised to include additional UT locations that fully characterize the void volume.</div>

                <div class="text-content">On October 11, 2023 at 1252 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, it was identified during response time testing in accordance with surveillance SP 3443E42, "Rakset 4 RCS Narrow Range RTD Time Response", that the reactor coolant system (RCS) loop 4 narrow range hot leg resistance temperature detector (RTD), 3RCS*TE441C, did not meet its response time acceptance criteria. AOP 3571, "Abnormal Operating Procedure", was entered at 1427 hours and the actions of Attachment A, "RCS Narrow Range Temperature Channel Failure", were performed. Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 action 6A and TS 3.3.2 action 20 were entered and the associated reactor protection system (RPS) bistables were placed in the trip condition. Required TS actions were completed on October 11, 2023 at 1517 hours. The temperature indicated by 3RCS*TE441C (Computer Point RCS-T441G) was consistent with the other two narrow range hot leg RTDs in loop 4. The trend of 3RCS*TE441C indicated diminished variation compared to other 11 narrow range hot leg temperature computer points beginning in June of 2022. Based on this trend it was determined that the 3RCS*TE441C slow response time had existed for longer than allowed by plant's technical specifications. On October 16 2023 at 1638, in accordance with SP 3442B04, "Hot Leg RTD Failure Compensation Procedure", 3RCS*TE441C was removed from the circuit and in its place, a biased average of the other two RTDs was inserted. The remaining two hot leg RTDs plus the biased signal returned the loop to operable, and bistables were restored to service. TS 3.3.1 action 6A and TS 3.3.2 action 20 were exited. During the Millstone Unit 3 refueling outage in October 2023, 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into its thermowell. The RTD was successfully replaced, calibrated, and response time tested in accordance with of surveillance SP 3443E42. Technical Specification 3.3.1 action 6A for Mode 1 and 2 states that with the number of operable channels one less than the total number of channels, during startup and/or power operation, may proceed provided following conditions are satisfied. (a) The inoperable channel is placed in tripped condition within 72 hours and (B) minimum channel operable requirement is met. Technical Specification 3.3.2 action 20 for Mode 1 and 2 states that with the number of operable channels one less than the total number of channels, during startup and/or power operation, may proceed provided following conditions are satisfied. (a) The inoperable channel is placed in tripped condition within 6 hours and (B) minimum channel operable requirement is met. This condition is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's technical specifications. CAUSE 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into the thermowell due to a loose coupling nut. The cause of the coupling nut becoming loose is unknown.</div>

                <div class="text-content">1. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S): The systems and components affected by this event include the reactor protection system (RPS) and the solid-state protection system (SSPS). The RPS at Callaway Plant initiates a unit shutdown, based on the values of selected unit parameters, to protect against violating the core fuel design limits and reactor coolant system pressure boundary design limits during anticipated operational occurrences and to assist the Engineered Safety Features systems in mitigating accidents. 2. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: Callaway was in MODE 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power at the time of this event. No major safety related systems were out of service. 3. EVENT DESCRIPTION: On January 7, 2022 at 1223 with the reactor at approximately 100% rated thermal power, the reactor automatically tripped as a result of a set of contacts internal to SSPS 'B' train Master Relay SB032CK524 that failed to close. Safety systems functioned as expected. The Operations staff responded to the event in accordance with applicable plant procedures. An ENS notification (EN# 55698) was made for this event at 1629 hours on January 7, 2022. Prior to the reactor trip, Operations and Instrumentation and Control (I&C) personnel coordinated the performance of ISF-SB-00A32, "SSPS Tm B Functional Test," and OSP-SB-0001B, "Reactor Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test," to perform regularly scheduled Technical Specification surveillances on the "B" Train Solid State Protection System and "B" Train Reactor Trip Breaker. All steps in both procedures were performed as written, with MC completing ISF-SB-00A32 as briefed prior to the performance of Section 6.4 of OSP-SB-0001B. With AC testing completed, Operations proceeded with the performance of Section 6.4 for the Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test (TADOT), which closes Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker "B" in order to conduct testing that opens Reactor Trip Breaker "B". By design, closing Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker "B" creates a General Warning signal which has the potential to trip the reactor if a second General Warning signal is received. After testing was completed and during the restoration of Section 6.4, once Reactor Trip Breaker "B" was closed, Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker "B" was opened. In accordance with OSP-SB-0001B, Operations verified that Annunciator 76A, "SSPS B GENERAL WARNING," was clear and that the General Warning red light on panel SB029B for SSPS Train 'B' was off. These indications led Operators to believe that the General Warning signal was no longer present, and consequently, the Operators proceeded on with Step 6.4.45 to return the multiplexer test switch through "Inhibit" to the "A+B" position at SB029B. Moving the multiplexer test switch through "Inhibit" is known to generate a second General Warning signal, but this is required to restore SSPS to the normal configuration. When Operations performed Step 6.4.45 to place the multiplexer test switch through "Inhibit" at SB029B, a reactor trip occurred unexpectedly. Per plant design, an auxiliary feedwater system actuation occurred as expected in response to the reactor trip. Also, consistent with plant response to a reactor trip from a high power level, a main feedwater isolation signal was generated. Following the reactor trip, an erratic position indication was observed for one feedwater isolation valve, but the valve was subsequently confirmed to be closed. In addition, one intermediate range nuclear instrumentation channel failed. Other nuclear instrumentation channels functioned correctly to indicate the shutdown state of the reactor. These failures did not complicate the  NRC FORM 3668 (08-2020) Page 2 of 4</div>

                <div class="text-content">I. Description of Event A. Reportable Event Classification This event is reportable per 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specification and per 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. Reporting Criterion 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) is “Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plants Technical Specifications except when: (1) The Technical Specification is administrative in nature; (2) The event consisted solely of a case of a late surveillance test where the oversight was corrected, the test was performed, and the equipment was found to be capable of performing its specified safety functions; or (3) The Technical Specification was revised prior to discovery of the event such that the operation or condition was no longer prohibited at the time of discovery of the event.” The Technical Specification action statement for an inoperable PORV due to excessive seat leakage allows continued operation with the associated block closed because manual operation of the PORV is still available. In contrast, the action statement for a PORV inoperable for reasons other than excessive seat leakage states: “restore the PORV to OPERABLE status or close the associated block valve and remove power from the block valve; within the following 72 hours restore the PORV to OPERABLE status” ... “or be in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours and in HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 6 hours.” In this event, the plant operated throughout the entire duration of Cycle 24 with PCV-0656A most likely not capable of meeting design requirements. This period exceeds the 72-hour allowed outage time of Technical Specification 3.4.4 Limiting Condition for Operations Action (b) for a PORV inoperable due to causes other than excessive seat leakage. Therefore, this event is considered reportable per 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. Reporting Criterion 50.73(a)(2)(v) is “Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (A) Shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B) Remove residual heat; (C) Control the release of radioactive material; or (D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.” Only one pressurizer PORV is required for RCS pressure control to reach safe shutdown or to mitigate the consequences of a steam generator tube rupture. Pressurizer PORV PCV-0655A never experienced excessive seat leakage during Cycle 24. Plant computer data and Unit 1 control room logs were reviewed for the duration of Cycle 24 to identify any periods when PCV-0655A was declared inoperable. From January 4, 2023, at 0750 until January 5, 2023, at 0415, the 125 Volt DC Bus which is the power supply for PCV-0655A was inoperable for surveillance testing. On January 4, 2023, a performance discharge test was performed on the 125 Volt DC Bus in accordance surveillance procedures. During the surveillance, the 125 Volt DC Bus breaker was opened, leaving the 125 Volt DC Bus powered by the battery chargers. Computer history shows the breaker was opened at 0757 and was closed at 1431 on January 4, 2023. During those six and a half hours, PORV PCV-0655A would not have power to actuate the Solenoid Operated Valve (SOV) to open the PORV if there was a loss of offsite power and either Standby Diesel Generator #11 or the 125 Volt DC Bus was not promptly restored. Because the safety related design function of the PORVs is manual RCS pressure control with a loss of offsite power, from 0757 until 1431 on January 4, 2023, the PORVs could not have fulfilled their safety function for manual control of RCS pressure.

                <div class="text-content">EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 6, 2022. at 0244 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 defueled at 0 percent power. an actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EIIS: JD] occurred during restoration of the Division B 72 hour DC bus [EIIS EJ / BU] in the Class 1E DC and Uninterruptible Power Supply System [EIIS. EJ]. During restoration. the breaker [EIIS: EJ / 72] for the Unit 3 Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel (3-IDSB-DD-1) was opened by the system operator (non licensed). This resulted in a loss of power to Division B powered safety related air-operated valves. causing the valves to reposition to their fail-safe, loss-of-power safety position. The reason for the RPS actuation was due to the opening of the Division B Passive Residual Heat Removal (PRHR) Heat Exchanger Outlet Flow Control Valve (3-PXS- V108B) [EIIS BP / FCV]. The reactor trip breakers were in an open state at the time of the event when the RPS signal was received. therefore. the reactor trip breakers did not change state. The operators responded with approved procedures and restored power to the Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel. EVENT ANALYSIS All systems operated as expected even though the Unit was not in operation. The cause of this event was inadequate procedural guidance. Specifically. procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001. "Class 1E DC System-Division B.- included instructions within the same attachment for both the 24 hour and 72 hour battery subsystems and resulted in operation of an unintended component. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the RPS signal was generated while the reactor was in a defueled condition and did not impact plant safety. Additionally. no radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the RPS: which is one of the systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED Procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001 was revised to improve the separation of steps associated with the 24 hour battery system and the 72 hour battery system alignments by separating them into different attachments in the procedure. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS There were no events from the last three years with either the same or similar cause to this event.</div>

                <div class="text-content">:EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 23, 2022, at 0405 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 6 at 0 percent power, the Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) Stage 4 Squib Valve [EIIS: AB / V] Component Interface Modules (CIMs) [EIIS: ,JE / IMOD] were discovered in "local" control, which rendered the associated ADS Stage 4 flow paths inoperable. Based on the CIMs being in "local," the ADS Stage 4 valves were inoperable when the unit entered the mode of applicability for Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.13. The applicability of TS LCO 3.4.13 is Mode 6 with upper internals in place, which occurred on October 22, 2022, at 1430 hours. Therefore, the placement of the upper internals resulted in the unit being in a condition prohibited by the TS, because TS 3.4.13 requires three flow paths in ADS 'Stage 4 to be operable in Mode 6 with the upper internals in place. The CIMs had been previously placed in "local" control for installation of the ADS Stage 4 squib valve actuator cartridges. The ADS Stage 4 CIMs being in "local" control was discovered while preparing to return ADS Stage 4 Division A to service on October 23, 2022. The CIMs being in "local" control would have prevented the automatic open function for these valves. This resulted in a condition where no Stage 4 ADS flow paths were operable during plant conditions that required at least three operable flow paths (i.e.. Mode 6 with Upper Internals in place in accordance with TS 3.4.13). The operators responded timely by placing the CIMs in "remote" for ADS Stage 4 Divisions A and C at 0432 EDT, and the CIMs for Divisions B and D were placed in "remote" at 0447 EDT, which restored operability to the required ADS Stage 4 flow paths and established compliance with the TS LCO 3.4.13. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a Safety System Functional Failure (SSFF), and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) as an event where a single cause or condition caused at least two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. EVENT ANALYSIS The root cause of this event was determined to be inadequate work processes. Procedures did not include a step to check CIM configuration prior to mode changes and procedural guidance was not in place to identify CIM status as part of TS compliance verification. Additionally, maintenance work control documents did not address restoration of the CIMs. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because during the time that the ADS Stage 4 flow paths were inoperable, there was no irradiated fuel in the core and no decay heat present. No radiological release occurred due to this event. Under alternate conditions, such as the presence of decay heat, manual actuation of ADS Stage 4 via the Diverse Actuation System (DAS) could have been utilized to open the valves. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function, due to the condition of having no ADS Stage 4 flow paths operable during the TS mode of applicability, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) as an event where a single cause or condition caused at least two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS COMPLETED • The mode change checklist procedure GOP-301 was revised to check CIM configuration prior to entry into applicable modes. • Reinforced with Planning and Procedure writers the importance and process for ensuring configuration control is restored to normal position.

                <div class="text-content">EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 24, 2022, at 0815 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 at 0% power, in Mode 6 after completion of the initial fuel load, Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 verifying that one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position was not met. Specifically, 3-DWS-V244 Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve [El IS: KJ / ISV] was in the open position, resulting in an unborated water source flow path without one valve verified secured in the closed position. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately, and Required Action A.2, verify boron concentration is within the limit specified in the COLR, was performed within 4 hours. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications (TS). The condition prohibited by the TS began when the unit entered Mode 6 on October 13, 2022, at 2354 hours and exited on October 25, 2022, at 1411 hours. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event is inadequate procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, "Unborated Water Source Checklist," which is the unborated water sources surveillance procedure required to be performed in accordance with SR 3.9.2.1 to verify proper isolation of each unborated water source flow path. Specifically, the dilution flow path was no longer accounted for due to a previous change to procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the boron concentration requirements of TS 3.9.1, "Boron Concentration," were met. No radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS COMPLETED Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, "Unborated Water Source Checklist", was revised to add additional unborated water isolations. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS None</div>
