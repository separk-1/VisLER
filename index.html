                <div class="text-content">On January 26, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP), 12 Diesel Driven Cooling Water Pump (DDCLP) auto started. Maintenance was in progress on 22 DDCLP and 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) was aligned as the replacement safety related pump for 22 DDCLP while non-safety related 21 Cooling Water (CL) pump was supporting the system loads. The 12 DDCLP auto started on a sensed low header pressure following the isolation of 22 Cooling Water Strainer for maintenance and subsequent auto initiation of backwash of the other Cooling Water Strainers. This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation. There were no nuclear safety impacts. The system operated as designed. All systems responded normally. The direct cause of this event was low pressure at the discharge of 12 DDCLP due to the isolation of the Cooling Water Strainer while 22 DDCLP was isolated during low CL system flow conditions. The corrective actions included securing the 12 DDCLP. In addition, procedure updates are planned.</div>

While performing the prerequisite checklists for Surveillance Procedure (SP) 2083A ?Å“Unit 2 Integrated SI Test with a Simulated Loss of Offsite Power Train A,??the Train B 22 Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pump selector switch in the Main Control Room was placed in Shutdown Auto from Manual. This, combined with having the Non-Safety Related 4160 Volt buses 21 and 22 isolated for maintenance, completed the automatic start signal. The turbine and pump did not turn because the equipment was out of service with the steam supply valves closed. This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Pressurized Water Reactor Auxiliary Feedwater actuation signal. There was no impact on the ability to maintain safe shutdown conditions. The system operated as designed. The cause of this event was a latent procedure error in SP 2083A. The corrective action was an update to the SP 2083A prerequisite checklist to place the 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump selector switch to Manual.</div>
