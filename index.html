                    <div class="text-content">At 0724 on June 15, 2022 while at approximately 100 percent power, the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 1 (BVPS-1) reactor was manually tripped due to lowering steam generator water levels. This was due to reduced heater drain flow from the heater drain system (HDS) to the main feedwater pumps (MFPs) when the heater drain receiver normal level control valve, LCV-1SD-106B, experienced a valve plug to stem separation. The Operators manually tripped the reactor as required per the predefined trip criteria for low steam generator water level. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1), and the automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6). Corrective actions include replacing the plug, stem, and pin (trim) of LCV-1SD-106B with an enhanced design during the next refueling outage (Fall 2022).</div>

The leak was not quantifiable as it consisted of a small amount of dry boric acid. Non-destructive examination (NDE) was performed on the leak to determine if it was a through wall leak. On October 3, 2023, at 1154 with Unit 2 in Mode 6 at 100 degrees F and atmospheric pressure, the NDE determined the leak was a through wall leak. This failure constitutes welding or material defects in the primary coolant system that cannot be found acceptable under ASME Section Xl. Therefore, an 8-hour report was made for a degraded condition under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A). The direct cause of the weld failure was due to inadequate welding process control by the welder.

                    <div class="text-content">At approximately 10:00 CDT on October 2, 2023, with Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the 1B residual heat removal (RHR) pump failed to start on demand during the quarterly surveillance run and was subsequently declared inoperable. The immediate investigation determined that the 1B RHR pump circiut breaker racking release handle had been placed in the &quot;Trip Free&quot; position instead of &quot;Operational&quot;. The same 1B RHR pump surveillance run was last completed satisfactorily on July 5, 2023, and there was no work on the 1B RHR pump between July 5th and October 2nd that would have required manipulation of the component&#x27;s breaker. The most likely cause was an inadvertent misposition of the wrong breaker during the 1B Emergency Diesel (EDG) surveillance the morning of August 28, 2023. Corrective actions included placing the circuit breaker racking release handle in the &quot;Operational&quot; position and addressing human performance issues with the performance management process. The surveillance was completed satisfactorily and the 1B RHR pump returned to operable status. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for the 1 B RHR pump being inoperable for longer than allowed by Technical Specification 3.5.2. FNP Unit 2 was not affected during this event.</div>

Maintenance technicians were performing PT/0/A/4600/012 A (Train A Reactor Trip Breakers Actuating Device Operational Test for Manual Trip Function) and removed the incorrect fuse in the 1A Solid State Protection System (SSPS) cabinet, temporarily deenergizing Train A SSPS Slave Relays. This caused the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit to reset, and in turn, start the 1A AFW pump. The Automatic Recirculation Valve (ARV) provided the required flow path for pump protection. Auxiliary Feedwater was not supplied to the respective Steam Generators due to the motor operated discharge isolation valves (MOVs) being closed as required for current plant conditions. At the time of the 1A AFW actuation, the Main Feedwater (MFW) pumps were in a tripped condition, and decay heat removal was being provided by the 1A Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System. Both MFW pumps being in tripped status provided the logic for the AFW actuation signal once the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit was reset. Corrective actions included personnel accountability and reinforcement of human performance tools.</div>

At the time, Unit 2 was in Mode 3, the 2B MFW pump was feeding the steam generators, and the 2A MFW Pump Recirculation Valve 2CF-76 was nonfunctional. At 0352 hours, Operations manually started the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Motor Driven Pumps to feed the steam generators to allow corrective maintenance on the MFW System. The AFW Motor Driven Pumps started as designed. Flow to the steam generators was not adversely impacted during this sequence. Subsequent investigation determined that the 2A and 2B MFW recirculation piping experienced abnormal vibration when flow was introduced through valves 2CF-76 and 2CF-81, making the valves susceptible to failure. The recirculation piping had recently been modified to replace the carbon steel elbow piping immediately downstream of the valves with a stainless steel target tee configuration. To mitigate the issue, the target tee was replaced with the original carbon steel elbow arrangement. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public.</div>

In response to the alarm, a Control Room Envelope (CRE) door was found ajar and immediately closed. Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.10, Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS), was declared not met for both trains and Condition B entered. At 1513 EST on March 1, 2021, the alarm cleared, CREVS was declared operable and LCO 3.7.10, Condition B was exited. The direct cause of this event was a human performance error when an individual traversing the control building complex did not fully challenge and ensure a MCR envelope boundary door was properly latched and secured. Contributing to this event, standards had not been properly established, communicated, and reinforced with plant staff related to operation of plant doors. Immediate corrective actions included closing the MCR door and coaching the individual. Actions to reduce the probability of recurrence include the development and communication of management expectations associated with operating plant doors. This condition is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).</div>

The cause of the PSV lift setting being out of tolerance is a personnel error that resulted in inadvertent installation of a valve that had previously demonstrated setpoint drift incompatible with TS criteria. The PSV was replaced with another PSV confirmed to have a lift setting within the TS allowed tolerance and no history of significant drift. The PSV with a history of significant setpoint drift will be retired from service. The +/-1% TS tolerance is more restrictive than the American Society of Mechanical Engineers code allowed tolerance of +/-3%. In addition, the safety analysis for the PSVs assumes a PSV tolerance of +/- 3%, so the as-found PSV lift setting of -1.3% is well within the safety analysis. Therefore, this event had no significance with respect to the health and safety of the public.</div>

Following investigation, it was determined that this radiation monitor was inoperable since October 6, 2020. During completion of a surveillance test on this radiation monitor on October 6th, the database values were restored incorrectly. Maintenance personnel did not recognize a note in the Radiation Monitor Data Sheet Library that requires substitute values to be entered when the flow transmitter for this radiation monitor is inoperable. Since this radiation monitor was not known to be inoperable from October 6, 2020, through June 22, 2021, no alternate method for monitoring was implemented and no special report was completed as required by Technical Specifications (TS).

The oscillation of the valves led to a steam generator water level transient that met predefined reactor trip criteria. The direct cause was the key lock switches for the recirculation valves were left in AUTO allowing the valves to modulate based on flow indication. The apparent cause was the unit supervisor did not properly read a procedure step from a startup procedure and the step was not performed. This is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1).

Both Motor Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (MDAFW) Pumps automatically started as designed when a &#x27;Loss of Both Main Feedwater Pumps (MFP)&#x27; signal was received upon the start failure of the &#x27;B&#x27; MFP, 2FWS-P21B. The 2FWS-P216 failure to start was because the lube oil (LO) pressure start permissive was not met when the LO system relief valve, 2FWS-RV205B, setpoint was set too low during the refueling outage. Also, the MDAFW pump auto-start signal was able to be generated during a plant condition where it was not necessary. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in the automatic actuation of the AFW System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6). Planned corrective actions include adjusting 2FWS-RV2056 setpoint to restore LO system margin and start-up procedures will be revised to disable the MDAFW Pump auto-start circuit when plant conditions do not require the auto-start function. Also, maintenance documents will be enhanced to clarify the desired setpoint value.</div>

The LLRT was performed during the C2R24 refueling outage at which time primary containment was not required to be operable. The leakage assigned to the penetration also resulted in total containment leakage exceeding the allowed overall leakage (L ). The valves were repaired and retested a satisfactorily prior to entering the mode of applicability. The most likely cause of the leakages from 2MISV5230 and 2MISV5231 is the degradation of the elastomer seat aggravated by the presence of a buildup of debris in the seating area and overly conservative testing methodology. This event was reported to the NRC as an eight-hour, non-emergency Event Notification Number 55275 on May 25, 2021, per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A), ?Å“event or condition that the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously degraded??</div>

The as-found lift setting was outside the Technical Specifications (TS) 3.4.10 and 1ST program limits. This required the removal and testing of the remaining two PSVs. The remaining two PSVs were also outside the TS and 1ST program limits. The three PSVs were replaced during the outage. An engineering analysis on the effects of these valves lifting at the as- found settings concluded that all acceptance criteria in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15 analyses are still met.  This condition of multiple pressurizer safety valves being outside of their required lift setting tolerance band is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(b),  Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant&#x27;s Technical Specifications...&quot;</div>

ENS notification #56005 was made at 2017 CDT in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for an auxiliary feedwater system actuation. All control rods dropped, all equipment functioned as designed, and offsite power remained available. The direct cause of the event was a failure of the valve stem for the &#x27;B&#x27; steam generator (SG) main feedwater regulating valve (MFRV), causing the valve to fail closed and resulting in a loss of feedwater flow control to the &#x27;B&#x27; SG. The hardware failure analysis performed on the valve stem determined that the failure of the valve stem was due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) initiating from the external surface within the region contained within the packing area. The root cause investigation found that during the previous valve rebuild, an inappropriate chemical (anti-seize) was applied to the stem for lubrication to assist in the rebuild. It was the presence of this chemical which caused the SSC that led to the failure. All four MFRVs are scheduled to be rebuilt during the upcoming refueling outage in October 2022 with all four valve stems then being sent off to be examined to look for evidence of SCC.</div>

                    <div class="text-content">With the plant at full power on January 7, 2022, an undetected relay failure caused the solid-state reactor protection system (SSPS) to actuate during restoration from a Reactor Trip Breaker &#x27;B&#x27; Trip Actuating Device Operational Test, thus resulting in an unplanned reactor trip. The reactor trip was reported per Event Notification 55698 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). The cause of the reactor trip was that procedure OSP-SB-0001B, &quot;Reactor Trip Breaker &#x27;B&#x27; Trip Actuating Device Operational Test,&quot; did not include adequate instructions for verifying the absence of a &quot;B&quot; train General Warning trip signal prior to operating the &quot;A&quot; train Multiplexer Test Switch during test restoration. This was due to inadequate guidance for development of the procedure. Corrective Actions include revising Operations surveillance procedures to include verification of green and amber test lights at panel SB032B during restoration and revising Operations and l&amp;C surveillance procedures to include verification that contacts for relays that have actuated during the test have changed back to their normal state, prior to test restoration. Additional corrective actions include revising the procedure preparation process, improving the screening and incorporation of Operating Experience, improving lesson plans, conducting training, placing operator aids adjacent to the Multiplexer Test Switch, and requiring an inspection on other master relays.</div>

A subsequent Engineering evaluation determined that due to the leakage, Train &#x27;C&#x27; EChWS should be considered inoperable from the date and time the 12C Essential Chiller was restored from maintenance and declared OPERABLE. With only two EChWS loops OPERABLE, Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.14 Action a requires restoration of the inoperable loop within 7 days or application of the Configuration Risk Management Program (CRMP), or to be in at least HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours. The Engineering evaluation determined that Train &#x27;C&#x27; EChWS was inoperable without any of the required TS actions taken from 1530 on 11/20/23 to 1245 on 11/28/23 when the CRMP was entered. This is a total of 189 hours and 15 minutes which exceeds the 174 hours (7 days plus 6 hours) allowed by the TS.
