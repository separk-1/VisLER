The leak was not quantifiable as it consisted of a small amount of dry boric acid. Non-destructive examination (NDE) was performed on the leak to determine if it was a through wall leak. On October 3, 2023, at 1154 with Unit 2 in Mode 6 at 100 degrees F and atmospheric pressure, the NDE determined the leak was a through wall leak. This failure constitutes welding or material defects in the primary coolant system that cannot be found acceptable under ASME Section Xl. Therefore, an 8-hour report was made for a degraded condition under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A). The direct cause of the weld failure was due to inadequate welding process control by the welder. Unit 1 was not impacted by this event. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.</div>

The cause of the leak was inadequate restraints on the piping, which allowed movement of the piping and resulted in a failure of the lube oil pressure boundary by the piping separating from the coupling. An additional cause was determined to be inadequate troubleshooting from a similar issue which occurred on November 4, 2022. To correct the issue, the existing lube oil pipe restraint for the 1B EDG was modified, and a new additional restraint was installed. The condition was later eliminated with the implementation of rigid piping. The troubleshooting process deficiencies and implementation weaknesses were corrected by revisions to the procedures that clearly define roles, responsibilities and required documentation for issue response, troubleshooting and corrective actions addressing deficient conditions. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) due to the 1B EDG being inoperable, which failed to meet the LCO in accordance with TS 3.0.1 and 3.8.1 between December 7, 2022, and March 3, 2023.</div>

                    <div class="text-content">On April 20, 2021, during the performance of the Catawba Nuclear Station Unit 2 reactor vessel closure head (RVCH) examinations, it was determined the Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 did not meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D) and ASME code case N-729-6. A relevant ultrasonic testing (UT) leak path indication was identified on Unit 2, nozzle penetration 74. The indication was confirmed in the J-groove weld with supplemental eddy current and liquid penetrant surface examinations. A bare metal visual examination of the RVCH was performed with no visual evidence of head penetration leakage detected. The cause of the Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 relevant indication is due to Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) from the Alloy 82/182 weld application in the primary system. Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 was repaired in accordance with the NRC approved Westinghouse embedded flaw repair method (WCAP-15987-P-A) and Duke Energy relief request RA-21-0145. This event was reported to the NRC as an eight-hour, non-emergency Event Notification Number 55201 on April 21, 2021, per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A).

The LLRT was performed during the C2R24 refueling outage at which time primary containment was not required to be operable. The leakage assigned to the penetration also resulted in total containment leakage exceeding the allowed overall leakage (L ). The valves were repaired and retested a satisfactorily prior to entering the mode of applicability. The most likely cause of the leakages from 2MISV5230 and 2MISV5231 is the degradation of the elastomer seat aggravated by the presence of a buildup of debris in the seating area and overly conservative testing methodology.

The trip was not complicated with all systems responding normally post-trip. The auxiliary feedwater system started automatically as expected. The 213 main feedwater pump tripped on loss of condenser vacuum due to a deficiency in the unit startup procedure. The procedure did not ensure the water/condensate in the main steam equalization header was properly drained prior to opening the main steam supply to the feedwater pump turbine (CFPT) valve. This introduced water into the 213 main feedwater pump turbine condenser causing a loss of vacuum which resulted in the 213 CFPT trip and manual reactor trip. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). There was no impact to the health and safety of the public.</div>

The cause of the trips and subsequent lockouts of the &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; SW pumps was attributed to low lube water pressure caused by fouling of the lube water Y-strainers. The fouling occurred since the normal weekly backflush of the Y-strainers could not be performed while a temporary alteration in support of maintenance (TASM) was installed in order to repair a leak in the permanent lube water piping. <span class="highlight highlight-Cause" data-details='{"extraction_class": "Cause", "extraction_text": "Preventive Maintenance (PM) tasks had not been initiated prior to the event to periodically clean the Y-strainers in order to compensate for the inability to backflush", "attributes": {"category": "conflicting_procedure", "code": "CF4"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 806, "end_pos": 973}}' title="Cause">Preventive Maintenance (PM) tasks had not been initiated prior to the event to periodically clean the Y-strainers in order to compensate for the inability to backflush</span>. <span class="highlight highlight-Cause" data-details='{"extraction_class": "Cause", "extraction_text": "the leak", "attributes": {"category": "not_applicable", "code": "NA-ME"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 975, "end_pos": 978}}' title="Cause">the leak</span> initial corrective action taken in response to the event was <span class="highlight highlight-CorrectiveAction" data-details='{"extraction_class": "Corrective_Action", "extraction_text": "cleaning of the Y-strainers in the lube water piping", "attributes": {"action_type": "maintenance"}, "char_interval": {"start_pos": 1040, "end_pos": 1092}}' title="CorrectiveAction">cleaning of the Y-strainers in the lube water piping</span>.

                    <div class="text-content">With the plant at full power on January 7, 2022, an undetected relay failure caused the solid-state reactor protection system (SSPS) to actuate during restoration from a Reactor Trip Breaker &#x27;B&#x27; Trip Actuating Device Operational Test, thus resulting in an unplanned reactor trip. The reactor trip was reported per Event Notification 55698 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). The cause of the reactor trip was that procedure OSP-SB-0001B, &quot;Reactor Trip Breaker &#x27;B&#x27; Trip Actuating Device Operational Test,&quot; did not include adequate instructions for verifying the absence of a &quot;B&quot; train General Warning trip signal prior to operating the &quot;A&quot; train Multiplexer Test Switch during test restoration. This was due to inadequate guidance for development of the procedure. Corrective Actions include revising Operations surveillance procedures to include verification of green and amber test lights at panel SB032B during restoration and revising Operations and l&amp;C surveillance procedures to include verification that contacts for relays that have actuated during the test have changed back to their normal state, prior to test restoration. Additional corrective actions include revising the procedure preparation process, improving the screening and incorporation of Operating Experience, improving lesson plans, conducting training, placing operator aids adjacent to the Multiplexer Test Switch, and requiring an inspection on other master relays.</div>

The de-energization of the south bus resulted in a loss of power to the Unit 2 standby transformer which was supplying power to the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) 4160V busses for the Unit 2 B Train. The associated Emergency Diesel Generator 22 automatically started in response to the undervoltage condition, as designed. The cause of this event was an electrical flashover on a Transmission Distribution Service Provider owned insulator on the south bus. This event is reportable as an event which resulted in the automatic actuation of the Unit 2 emergency AC electrical power systems. Corrective actions included replacing the insulator, performing inspections for abnormal electrical Corona on the insulators (no adverse values were found), and cleaning of the other insulators on the North and South bus. There were no previous indications of issues with the insulator. The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates and there were no personnel injuries or damage to any safety-related equipment associated with this event. Additionally, all ESF equipment operated as designed. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.</div>
