Vogtle Electric Generating Plant,3,Automatic Reactor Trip Signal due to Inadequate Procedure Guidance Causing Incorrect Opening of Division B DC Supply Breaker,10/6/2022,"On October 6, 2022, at 0244 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 defueled at 0 percent power, the Reactor Protection System automatically actuated during restoration of Division B Class 1E DC and Uninterruptible Power Supply system. The cause of the actuation was due to inadequate procedural guidance. During restoration of VEGP Unit 3 Division B 72 hour DC bus, the breaker for the Unit 3 Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel was opened while performing a lineup to establish initial conditions in accordance with the associated System Operating Procedure (SOP). This resulted in a loss of power to Division B powered safety related air-operated valves, causing the valves to reposition to their fail-safe, loss-of- power safety position. Due to 3-PXS-V108B (Passive Residual Heat Removal Heat Exchanger Outlet Flow Control Valve) failing open a Reactor Trip signal was generated. The operators responded with approved procedures and restored power to the Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel. As corrective action to address the cause of the event, procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001 was revised to improve separation of the 24 hour and 72 hour battery system alignments. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System, which is one of the systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). VEGP Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 4 were unaffected during this event.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 6, 2022. at 0244 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 defueled at 0 percent power. an actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EIIS: JD] occurred during restoration of the Division B 72 hour DC bus [EIIS EJ / BU] in the Class 1E DC and Uninterruptible Power Supply System [EIIS. EJ]. During restoration. the breaker [EIIS: EJ / 72] for the Unit 3 Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel (3-IDSB-DD-1) was opened by the system operator (non licensed). This resulted in a loss of power to Division B powered safety related air-operated valves. causing the valves to reposition to their fail-safe, loss-of-power safety position. The reason for the RPS actuation was due to the opening of the Division B Passive Residual Heat Removal (PRHR) Heat Exchanger Outlet Flow Control Valve (3-PXS- V108B) [EIIS BP / FCV]. The reactor trip breakers were in an open state at the time of the event when the RPS signal was received. therefore. the reactor trip breakers did not change state. The operators responded with approved procedures and restored power to the Division B 24 hour DC distribution panel. EVENT ANALYSIS All systems operated as expected even though the Unit was not in operation. The cause of this event was inadequate procedural guidance. Specifically. procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001. ""Class 1E DC System-Division B.- included instructions within the same attachment for both the 24 hour and 72 hour battery subsystems and resulted in operation of an unintended component. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the RPS signal was generated while the reactor was in a defueled condition and did not impact plant safety. Additionally. no radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the RPS: which is one of the systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED Procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001 was revised to improve the separation of steps associated with the 24 hour battery system and the 72 hour battery system alignments by separating them into different attachments in the procedure.

Vogtle Electric Generating Plant,3,Automatic Depressurization System Stage 4 Flow Paths Inoperable During Mode 6 with Upper Internals in Place Due to Inadequate Work Processes,10/23/2022,"On October 23, 2022, at 0405 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 6 at 0 percent power, the Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) Stage 4 Squib Valve Component Interface Modules (CIMs) were discovered in ""local"" control while preparing to return ADS Stage 4 Division A to service, which rendered the associated ADS Stage 4 flow paths inoperable. The operators responded timely by placing all ADS Stage 4 Squib Valve CIMs in ""remote"" to restore operability to the ADS Stage 4 flow paths. The root cause of the event was inadequate work processes. The corrective actions completed for this event include revision of the mode change checklist procedure GOP-301 and reinforcement of configuration management with maintenance work planners. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) as an event where a single cause or condition caused at least two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.",":EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 23, 2022, at 0405 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 6 at 0 percent power, the Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) Stage 4 Squib Valve [EIIS: AB / V] Component Interface Modules (CIMs) [EIIS: ,JE / IMOD] were discovered in ""local"" control, which rendered the associated ADS Stage 4 flow paths inoperable. Based on the CIMs being in ""local,"" the ADS Stage 4 valves were inoperable when the unit entered the mode of applicability for Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.13. The applicability of TS LCO 3.4.13 is Mode 6 with upper internals in place, which occurred on October 22, 2022, at 1430 hours. Therefore, the placement of the upper internals resulted in the unit being in a condition prohibited by the TS, because TS 3.4.13 requires three flow paths in ADS 'Stage 4 to be operable in Mode 6 with the upper internals in place. The CIMs had been previously placed in ""local"" control for installation of the ADS Stage 4 squib valve actuator cartridges. The ADS Stage 4 CIMs being in ""local"" control was discovered while preparing to return ADS Stage 4 Division A to service on October 23, 2022. The CIMs being in ""local"" control would have prevented the automatic open function for these valves. This resulted in a condition where no Stage 4 ADS flow paths were operable during plant conditions that required at least three operable flow paths (i.e.. Mode 6 with Upper Internals in place in accordance with TS 3.4.13). The operators responded timely by placing the CIMs in ""remote"" for ADS Stage 4 Divisions A and C at 0432 EDT, and the CIMs for Divisions B and D were placed in ""remote"" at 0447 EDT, which restored operability to the required ADS Stage 4 flow paths and established compliance with the TS LCO 3.4.13. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a Safety System Functional Failure (SSFF), and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) as an event where a single cause or condition caused at least two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. EVENT ANALYSIS The root cause of this event was determined to be inadequate work processes. Procedures did not include a step to check CIM configuration prior to mode changes and procedural guidance was not in place to identify CIM status as part of TS compliance verification. Additionally, maintenance work control documents did not address restoration of the CIMs. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because during the time that the ADS Stage 4 flow paths were inoperable, there was no irradiated fuel in the core and no decay heat present. No radiological release occurred due to this event. Under alternate conditions, such as the presence of decay heat, manual actuation of ADS Stage 4 via the Diverse Actuation System (DAS) could have been utilized to open the valves. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function, due to the condition of having no ADS Stage 4 flow paths operable during the TS mode of applicability, and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) as an event where a single cause or condition caused at least two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.

Abstract (Limit to 1 560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 24, 2022, Vogtle Unit 3 identified that Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 to ""Verify one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position,"" was not met, placing the unit in Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.2 Condition A. The Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve 3-DWS-V244 was open, having previously been removed from procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, ""Unborated Water Source Checklist,"" without adding adequate requirements for alternate isolation valves in the Chemical and Volume Control system. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately and Required Action A.2 was performed within 4 hours. The apparent cause of this event was that the procedure to perform SR 3.9.2.1 (3-RCS-OTS-20-001) was inadequate in ensuring unborated water sources were properly isolated. The immediate corrective action was to close and secure the valve in the flow path. Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001 was revised to add the missing unborated water isolation valves. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected during this event.

Vogtle Electric Generating Plant,3,Manual Actuation of Reactor Protection System During Mode 3 Due to an Inadequate Procedure Step,1/14/2023,"On January 14, 2023. at 0721 EST with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 3 at 0 percent power, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) was manually actuated while conducting pre-criticality testing. The manual RPS actuation was in response to low gland steam pressure. The reactor trip breakers were in an open state prior to the RPS actuation. The cause of this event was an inadequate procedure step. This step was revised to require checking reactor trip breakers are not open prior to manually tripping the reactor in response to gland steam pressure below the procedural limit. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in manual actuation of the RPS. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 14, 2023, at 0721 EST with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 3 at 0 percent power, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EIIS: JC] was manually actuated. A gland steam system [EIIS: TC] pressure transient occurred during pre-criticality testing. Operators responded in accordance with the applicable Abnormal Operating Procedure (AOP) 3-AOP-202, ""Condensate System Malfunctions,"" which required initiation of a manual reactor trip. There were no structures, systems or components that were out of service at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in manual actuation of the RPS. EVENT CAUSE ANALYSIS The cause of this event was determined to be an inadequate procedure step. The procedure 3-AOP-202 required a manual actuation of the RPS, when responding to low gland steam pressure, without first checking status of the reactor trip breakers. Since the reactor trip breakers were already open, the procedurally directed reactor trip was an unnecessary RPS actuation. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to manual actuation of the RPS. There were no safety consequences due to this event. When the reactor was manually tripped, the reactor trip breakers were already in an open state, there was no irradiated fuel in the core, and there was no decay heat present. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Procedure 3-AOP-202, ""Condensate System Malfunctions,"" was revised to require checking reactor trip breakers are not open prior to manually tripping the reactor when responding to gland steam pressure below the AOP's established limit.

Vogtle Electric Generating Plant,3,"Automatic RPS Actuation During Mode 1 Due to Incorrect Relay Settings Caused by Less Than Adequate Questioning Attitude, Validation of Assumptions, andlnterface/Guidance",3/15/2023,"On March 15, 2023, at 2157 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, during startup testing, the Reactor Protection System automatically actuated. The operators responded timely by ensuring plant stability, with decay heat removal accomplished by steam generator power operated relief valves. The cause of the event was incorrect protective relay settings on Medium Voltage Switchgear buses ES-4 and ES-6, due to less than adequate questioning attitude, validation of assumptions, and interface/guidance. The corrective actions for this event include the proper setting of the protective relays for buses ES-4 and ES-6 and the revision of guidance for issuing work instructions to include a statement to ensure that the scope of work includes those items listed as additional equipment when multiple components are included in a single work order. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On March 15, 2023, at 2157 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, during startup testing, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EIIS: JC] automatically actuated. The initiating event was a Unit 3 main turbine [EIIS: TA / TRB] trip due to a differential trip of the excitation transformer protective relays [EIIS: EL / 87]. After the turbine trip, the fast bus transfer function failed on non-safety related alternating current (AC) power buses ES-4 and ES-6 [EIIS: EA / BU] due to incorrect protective relay settings [EIIS: EA / RLY]. The loss of voltage on the affected AC power buses resulted in the loss of two (2) of the four (4) Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs) [EIIS: AB / P]. The loss of these RCPs initiated the RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the RPS. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of the RPS actuation was incorrect settings on Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories protective relays (SEL 451) on Medium Voltage Switchgear buses ES-4 and ES-6, due to less than adequate questioning attitude, validation of assumptions, and interface/guidance. Changes to the relay settings for buses ES-4 and ES-6 were being implemented by Maintenance under one (1) work order. Work Management specifically identified bus ES-1 in the work order scope. The relays for buses ES-4 and ES-6 were included as additional equipment in the work order, but they were not included in the work scope. As a result, the implementation of the design change for the relay settings was only implemented on the relay for bus ES-1. Consequently, settings for relays on buses ES-4 and ES-6 were not changed as intended by the work order. This resulted in failure of the fast bus transfer function due to the relay settings, resulting in the loss of voltage to two (2) RCPs. SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by steam generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ??The settings were corrected for protective relays for Medium Voltage Switchgear buses ES-4 and ES-6, which were not included in the scope of work in the original work order. Prior to correction of the relay settings, Medium Voltage Switchgear buses ES-4 and ES-6 were aligned to the Reserve Auxiliary Transformers during subsequent testing to place the main generator on-line. This alignment avoids the need for the fast-bus transfer function, if a main generator lockout were to occur. ??Guidance for issuing work instructions will be revised to include a statement that ensures that the scope of work includes items listed as additional equipment, when multiple components are worked under a single work order. This is expected to be completed by June 13, 2023.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e , approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the reactor protection system was automatically actuated due to low reactor coolant flow while conducting main generator testing activities. The operators responded timely by stabilizing the plant and removing decay heat by the steam generator power operated relief valves. The cause of the event was incorrect turbine control valve logic setting which resulted in inadequate turbine speed and generator voltage. The corrective action for this event adjusted the turbine control valve logic setting to open the valves sufficiently to maintain turbine speed and generator output voltage to support house loads during operation in island mode (with the generator disconnected from the grid and supplying unit auxiliary loads). This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor protection system, which tripped the reactor. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.

LER NUMBER 0  050 YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 00025 NUMBER NO. 2023 0 052 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EllS: JC] was automatically actuated during main generator system [EIIS: EL] startup testing. While performing procedure 3-ZAS-MEM-002, ""Main Generator Initial Synchronization Testing,"" with the main generator connected to the offsite power grid and supplying approximately 65 Megawatts (MW), the switchyard breakers [EIIS: FK / BKR] ZBS-161750 and ZBS-161850 were opened to disconnect the main generator from the offsite power grid and place the generator into island mode (supplying unit auxiliary loads). Shortly after placing the main generator in island mode, the turbine control system [EIIS: JJ] was not able to automatically maintain speed at the required 1800 rpm. This caused a reduction of speed and output voltage from the main generator, which resulted in a reduction in the speed of the Reactor Coolant Pumps [EIIS: AB / P]. This caused reduction in the reactor coolant flowrate, which resulted in the automatic RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the RPS. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event was an incorrect turbine control valve setting, which was not identified through oversight of legacy design. The turbine control valve high limit setting was not set to maintain house loads during island mode operation. The turbine control valve high limit setting was set at 7 percent, which was a default value for turbine speed control and was not sufficient to support island mode operation. The software was changed to increase the high limit setting from 7 to 25 percent to support island mode operation. SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely following the reactor trip by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by steam generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event. There were no equipment failures that contributed to the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The turbine control valve setting was corrected by a software design change to increase the setting from 7 to 25 percent.

Vogtle Electric Generating Plant,3,Manual Reactor Protection System Actuation Due to Condenser Flanges Not Removed During Construction,5/2/2023,"On May 2, 2023, at 0423 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 14 percent power, during startup testing, the reactor was manually tripped due to loss of feedwater flow. The loss of feedwater was due to high differential pressure across the main feedwater pump suction strainers, which was caused by a secondary plant transient. The secondary plant transient was caused by shipping flanges which had remained installed in the condensate flowpath. The operators responded to ensure plant stability, with decay heat removal by discharging steam to the main condenser using the steam dumps and startup feedwater supplying the steam generators. The corrective actions for this event included removal of the shipping flanges, inspection and cleaning of Main Feedwater Pump suction strainers, and repair of the feedwater heater drain cooler bypass valve that failed due to an increased cycling frequency from blockage of the condensate normal drain path. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On May 2, 2023, at 0423 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 14 percent power, during startup testing, the reactor was manually tripped. The initiating event was automatic isolation of three feedwater heater [EIIS: SM / HX] strings due to high level in low-pressure feedwater heaters and a subsequent manual trip of the main turbine [EIIS: TA / TRB] from 75 percent power. Following the turbine trip, high differential pressure was observed across the suction strainers [EIIS: SJ / STR] of all three main feedwater pumps [ENS: SJ / P], requiring a manual reactor trip due to loss of all feedwater flow as a result of this secondary plant transient. The reactor power was at 14 percent when the Reactor Protection System (RPS) was manually actuated. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in manual actuation of the RPS. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause leading to the manual RPS actuation was blockage of the normal drain paths from drain coolers by the shipping flanges in the condenser flashbox nozzles, which was a legacy construction issue. With the shipping flanges in place, the normal drain paths from the low pressure drain tanks [EIIS: SM / TK] to the condensers [EIIS: SG / COND] were not effective, resulting in more frequent cycling of the feedwater heater drain cooler bypass air-operated valves [EIIS: SM / LCV] to compensate for the blocking of the heater drain system normal drain paths to the condensers through the feedwater heater drain coolers. This resulted in a failure of the feedwater heater drain cooler bypass air-operated valve 3-HDS-V021B [EIIS: SM / LCV], which initiated the feedwater heater string isolations, requiring the operators to initiate a manual turbine trip. The dynamic forces from the turbine trip from 75 percent power caused solids that had accumulated in the secondary systems to become loose and drawn into the suction strainers for the main feedwater pumps, reducing flow to the steam generators and reducing steam generator inventory. The reactor trip was manually actuated due to loss of feedwater flow. SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the manual actuation of the RPS maintained the plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by discharging steam to the main condenser [EIIS: SG / COND] using the steam dump valves [EIIS: SB / PCV] and supplying the steam generators [EIIS: SB / SG] using the startup feedwater pumps [EIIS: SJ / P]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ??Inspected heater drain system piping and removed blind flanges from drain cooler A, B, and C to the condenser outlet piping ??Repaired the feedwater heater drain cooler bypass air-operated valve 3-HDS-021B ??Inspected and cleaned the main feedwater pump suction strainers PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS None",0252023004R00,0252023004R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant,1,"Service Water Pump ""A"" declared inoperable due to winding failure following replacement resulting in violation of Technical Specifications LCO 3.7.8.A (one Service Water pump inoperable greater than 14 days)",6/2/2021,"On 5/17/2021, the Service Water Pump ""A"" motor was removed from service for planned maintenance. Following maintenance, the pump was tested, declared operable, and secured. On 06/02/2021, the pump was placed into service. At 1825, after 11 hours of operation, the Control Room received alarms due to failure of the motor. The circuit breaker had tripped on instantaneous overcurrent. A standby Service Water Pump was started at 1826 to restore full flow. Locally there was evidence of motor overheating. The primary plant remained stable throughout the event. The motor was replaced, and Service Water Pump ""A"" was restored to operable on 06/05/2021. It was later determined that the stator had experienced a turn-to-turn short that eventually shorted the coil to ground through the stator core and to an adjacent phase causing a phase to phase short circuit and subsequent breaker trip. The most likely cause of the turn-to turn short was a defect in the magnet wire insulation used in the coils during a motor rewind in 2006. The exact type of latent defect could not be determined; therefore, reasonable assurance of operability of Service Water Pump ""A"" could not be established. As a result, the Service Water Pump was inoperable for a duration longer than allowed by Technical Specifications Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.8 Condition (A) - 14 days. This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a) (2)(i)(B) for a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.","I. PRE-EVENT PLANT CONDITIONS At the time the condition was identified, the plant was in MODE 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power. II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A. EVENT On 5/17/2021, the Service Water Pump ""A"" motor was removed from service for planned maintenance. Following maintenance, the pump passed its surveillance test, was declared operable, and was secured. On 06/02/2021, the pump was placed into service. At 1825, after 11 hours of operation, the Control Room received alarms due to failure of the Service Water Pump ""A"" motor. Operators responded to the alarms and, based on Control Room indication of a tripped pump and lowered pressure in the Service Water loop, started a standby Service Water Pump at 1826, restoring the loop to normal conditions. It was subsequently determined that the feeder breaker had tripped on instantaneous overcurrent. Locally, Operators found no active fire but evidence of motor overheating. The primary plant remained stable throughout the event. The motor was replaced, and Service Water Pump ""A"" was restored to operable on 06/05/2021. Based on further investigation, it was later determined that the stator had experienced a turn-to-turn short that eventually shorted the coil to ground through the stator core and to an adjacent phase causing a phase to phase short circuit and subsequent breaker trip. The most likely cause of the turn-to-turn short was a defect in the magnet wire insulation used in the coils during a motor rewind in 2006; however, due to the destruction in the fault area, the exact type of latent defect could not be determined. Numerous possible contributing causes were evaluated. The original manufacturing defect likely occurred during rewind and could later have been exacerbated during refurbishment, storage, or testing, as evidenced by satisfactory service following rewind but a short service life following refurbishment. Reasonable assurance of operability of Service Water Pump ""A"" could not be established for the period from 05/17/2021 to 06/02/2021. As a result, the Service Water Pump was inoperable for a period of 19 days, a duration longer than allowed by Technical Specifications Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.8 Condition (A) - 14 days plus the allowed Technical Specification Completion Time of 0.25 days, or 14.25 days in total. This duration meets the definition of ""Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications"" and is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). Actions to prevent recurrence include improving motor repair specifications, evaluating refurbishment frequency, managing cold/hot starts, and use of motor heaters during storage. B.

Ginna Nuclear Power Plant,1,Valid Auxiliary Feedwater System Actuation on Lowered Steam Generator Level due to Failure to Control Main Feed Water Flow and Delay in Closing Main Steam Isolation Valves,10/4/2021,"On 10/4/21 during a shutdown for the 2021 Refueling Outage, following the planned reactor trip, Reactor Coolant Average Temperature (Tavg) lowered due to overfeeding the 'B' Steam Generator (S/G). To maintain Tavg, feed to the S/Gs was minimized. During the cooldown, 'A' S/G lowered and a valid actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System occurred. The valid actuation of the AFW System is reportable per 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) and 10CFR50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A). No equipment position changes were noted as a result of the actuation, which is the expected response for the given plant conditions. The causes of this event were Operators failed to control Main Feedwater Flow following Reactor Trip resulting in a cooldown and did not promptly close the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs). Corrective actions include procedures revisions to include specific guidance on FRV Bypass Valve and MSIV closure. Training will be conducted to address gaps in Tavg control following Reactor Trip.","I.P RE-EVENT PLANT CONDITIONS At the time of the event, the plant was in MODE 3 following a planned manual reactor trip during a plant shutdown. II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A. EVENT On 10/4/21 during a shutdown for the 2021 Refueling Outage, following the planned reactor trip, Reactor Coolant Average Temperature (Tavg) lowered due to overfeeding the 'B' Steam Generator (S/G). To maintain Tavg, feed to the S/Gs was minimized. During the cooldown, 'A' S/G lowered and resulted in an unplanned entry into LCO 3.4.5, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Loops - MODES 1, </=8.5% rated thermal power (RTP), 2, and 3. As S/G Level lowered, a valid Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) actuation signal was generated. The 'A' Train AFW System was already in service and aligned when the actuation signal was generated. No equipment position changes were noted as a result of the actuation, which is the expected response for the given plant conditions. Prior to the reactor trip, the 'B' Feedwater Regulating Valve (FRV) Bypass Valve was placed in manual. Following the reactor trip, the 'B' FRV Bypass Valve did not close. When in manual, FRVs and FRV Bypass Valves will not automatically close on a reactor trip. ??B??S/G level rose to a maximum of 63% over 8 minutes prior to the FRV Bypass Valve being manually closed by Operators. Feedwater was secured to the S/Gs; however, Tavg lowered and stabilized at approximately 535 degrees. During this time the ??B??Main Feedwater Pump was secured so AFW flow could be established and was subsequently minimized to reduce the cooldown effects on Tavg. ??A??S/G level lowered to 6% and the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) were closed to limit secondary side steam flows and raise Tavg.

As the plant was in MODE 5 where Technical Specifications (TS) 3.8.2 requires only one operable EDG, there was no immediate consequence to plant operation, but a corroded/bound breaker shunt trip attachment (STA) plunger discovered upon investigation indicated that the breaker would not have operated earlier. The last successful trip of the EDG B breaker was in MODE 1 on 04/06/2023 at 0543 during routine surveillance testing. MODE 5 was achieved at 04/10/2023 at 1507; consequently, for 4 days 9.4 hours, two operable EDGs were required per TS 3.8.1, but only one EDG was operable (except on 04/07/2023 when EDG A was inoperable for identical routine surveillance testing, and, for 4 hours 11 minutes, no EDGs were operable). The resultant violations of TS 3.8.1 Conditions B.1, B.3.1, and B.3.2 are reportable as Conditions Prohibited by TS [50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)] and E.1 as an Event or Condition that Could Have Prevented Fulfillment of a Safety Function [50.73(a)(2)(v)].

During the performance of Train B surveillance STP-O-R-2.2-TR-B, Diesel Generator Load and Safeguard Sequence Test, Bus 17 did not load onto Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) B following a Safety Injection (SI) signal. Main Control Board (MCB) alarms L-15 (Bus 17 Under Voltage Safeguards) and L-13 (Safeguard Bus D/G Breaker Overcurrent Trip) were received. The alarm switch for breaker 52/EG1B2 was found actuated but with no Amptector targets indicated. A recorder set up during the test showed that the breaker tripped free (closed and then immediately reopened). With the breaker racked out, inspection of the STA moving core identified that the plunger was entirely coated in surface rust, was not fully reset from the previous trip of the breaker, and was preventing future breaker closure, thus causing it to be inoperable. Upon identification of the STA moving core rust, the breaker was immediately replaced with a spare breaker of the same type and model. Following a successful test, system operability was restored. Only one EDG is required in MODE 5 per Technical Specification 3.8.2; thus, there was no immediate consequence to plant operation. Two EDGs are required to supply SI loads during a Design Basis Accident (DBA) in MODES 1-4 based on Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1. B.

The ?Å“first out??annunciator was for an Overtemperature Delta Temperature (OTDT) Trip (protection from departure from nucleate boiling). As expected for a complete load rejection, the Power Operated Relief Valves (PORVs) opened to mitigate the pressure transient prior to the setpoint for reactor trip being reached. The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) pumps started on an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) Mitigation System Actuation Circuitry (AMSAC) signal. Following the trip and entry into MODE 3, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature lowered (later identified to be due to seat leakage on some of the steam dump valves). The Operators stabilized the plant in by closing the Main Steam Isolation Valves and then controlled Tavg using Atmospheric Relief Valves (ARVs). Closure of both the control and intercept valves indicates that the auxiliary governor solenoids (20-1AG and 20-2AG) on the governor pedestal actuated upon a signal from the Overspeed Protection Circuit (OPC).

R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant,1,"Supplement to LER 2023-003-00, Manual Reactor Trip due to Degraded Condenser Vacuum from Lowering Main Steam to Air Ejectors and Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation due to low Steam Generator Level",10/12/2023,"On 10/12/2023, Ginna Unit 1 experienced an uncomplicated manual reactor trip due to high Main Condenser back pressure and a valid Auxiliary Feedwater actuation due to low Steam Generator level. At 2116, Operations received a high limit alarm for Air Ejector Mass Flow Rate and observed condenser vacuum degrading and generator output beginning to lower. Field personnel began bypassing the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control Valve to restore steam to the Air Ejectors. Concurrently with actions in the field, the Main Control Room (MCR) Operators began a procedurally directed downpower. At 2127, the five-minute restriction for turbine operation in the 'Back Pressure' region was exceeded and the MCR Unit Supervisor directed a reactor trip as procedurally required. Loss of supply air to the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control Valve was due to the Instrument Air (IA) Pressure Control Valve (PCV) not providing adequate output pressure to keep the valve open. The IA PCV was replaced and tested satisfactory prior to return to service.","I.P RE-EVENT PLANT CONDITIONS At the time of the component failure, the plant was in MODE 1 at 100% rated thermal power. II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT A. EVENT On 10/12/2023 at 2127, Operations staff at Ginna Unit 1 initiated a manual reactor trip due to high Main Condenser back pressure. The trip was uncomplicated and the operating crew stabilized the plant at the no-load reactor coolant temperature. The operating crew received a Plant Process Computer System (PPCS) high limit alarm for Air Ejector Mass Flow Rate at 2116. Operators concurrently observed condenser vacuum degrading and generator output beginning to lower. Loss of Condenser Vacuum procedure was entered. The Field Supervisor and Principal Plant Operator (PPO) were dispatched to investigate and found that the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control Air Operated Valve (AOV) was approximately 20% open and closing and steam supply pressure to the Air Ejectors was abnormally low and lowering. Field personnel began bypassing the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control AOV to restore steam to the Air Ejectors. At approximately 2125, field personnel were successful in bypassing the valve and restoring Air Ejector operation. Concurrently with actions in the field, the Main Control Room (MCR) Operators began a procedurally directed downpower. At 2125 the Main Condenser back pressure began to lower, approximately 30 seconds after Air Ejector operation was restored. At 2127, the five minute restriction for turbine operation in the 'Back Pressure' region was exceeded and the MCR Unit Supervisor directed a reactor trip as required per the Loss of Condenser Vacuum procedure. Loss of supply air to the Main Air Ejector Steam Pressure Control valve was the result of the Instrument Air Pressure Control Valve failing to provide adequate output pressure to maintain the valve in the open position. The Instrument Air Pressure Control Valve was replaced and tested satisfactory prior to return to service. B.

,Unknown Unit,Automatic Reactor Trip due to Reactor Trip Breaker Cell Switch Malfunction,3/1/2021,"On 3/1/21 at 11:08 hours, Turkey Point Unit 3 experienced an unplanned reactor trip from 100% power. Restoration from a routine test of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) was in progress when the reactor trip occurred. As expected for the conditions, the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically initiated in response to the reactor trip to maintain Steam Generator levels in normal bands. All equipment required for the immediate reactor trip response functioned normally. A malfunction of the B-train Reactor Trip Breaker cubicle cell switch during the RPS test restoration caused the reactor trip. The breaker and cell switch have since been replaced and Unit 3 returned to normal power operation. This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for initiation of the Reactor Protection [10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B) (1)] and Auxiliary Feedwater [10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6)] systems.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On 3/1/21 at 11:08 hours, Turkey Point Unit 3 experienced an unplanned reactor trip from 100% power. Restoration from a regularly scheduled test of the RPS was in progress when the reactor trip occurred. In response to the reactor trip, the AFW system [BA] automatically initiated to maintain Steam Generator [SG] levels stable within normal post-trip bands, which is expected following a reactor trip from a higher power level. Restoration steps in the 3B Reactor Protection System Logic Test (procedure 3-SMI-049.02B), were being followed at the time of the reactor trip. The test is scheduled every quarter to meet the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements of TS 4.3.1, Table 4.3-1, Functional Unit 20. The surveillance procedure aligns the RPS in a train-specific test configuration that utilizes the A-Train or B-Train Reactor Trip Bypass Breaker (BYA or BYB) [AA, BKR] and checks that the normal Reactor Trip Beaker (RTA or RTB) [AA, BKR] actuates in response to several trip logic inputs. During restoration of the B-Train test, with the RTB closed, the reactor trip occurred when the BYB was tripped open for restoration. All equipment required for the immediate reactor trip response functioned properly. However, CV-3-2830, 3D Steam Dump to Condenser (SDTC) [SB, V], was slow to respond after the valve was demanded closed. This increased the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) cooldown rate, lowering Pressurizer level and automatically isolating RCS letdown. The Reactor Operator took manual control of the Pressurizer level function and restored letdown as directed by procedure. SDTC position and Pressurizer level are not referenced during Immediate Operator Actions (IOAs) and did not complicate the response to the reactor trip. Corrective actions were taken to resolve the deficiencies associated with the RTB and CV-3-2830 prior to returning Unit 3 to service. CAUSE Reactor Trip and Bypass breaker cubicle cell switches provide logic inputs to the turbine trip primary and backup relays. The SOE report revealed that the reactor trip signal was initiated by turbine trip logic. The most likely cause identified by the Engineering team was that following the RPS surveillance, with the RTB racked in, a RTB cell switch was incorrectly providing racked-out position logic input to the backup turbine trip relay. When the BYB was tripped open during restoration, the logic to actuate the backup turbine trip relay was completed, tripping the turbine and initiating Train-A and Train-B reactor trip signals. The Westinghouse DB-50 Reactor Trip and Bypass breakers utilize cell switch contacts located inside the breaker cubicles that provide open position logic to the turbine trip relays if the breaker is racked out. Failure analysis performed jointly between FPL Engineering and Westinghouse revealed that the most likely cause of the incorrect RTB position logic was failure of the cell switch contact. Graphite grease used for lubrication was found accumulated and hardened, creating an electrical tracking path for the incorrect logic signal. A review of the FPL preventive maintenance procedure showed that steps to clean and reapply grease on the switch contacts is condition-based rather than prescriptive. The sluggish performance of CV-3-2830 was caused by an instrument air leak from its modulating solenoid, SV-3-1440 [SB, SSV].",2502021001R00,2502021001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
,Unknown Unit,Unrecognized Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement Non-Compliance,4/15/2021,"On 4/15/2021 FPL identified that Reactor Protection System (RPS) Technical Specification Functional Unit (FU) 20 had not met Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements (TSSRs) during 5 discrete periods over the past 3 years. Due to RPS design limitations, FU20, Automatic Trip and Interlock Logic, could not be fully tested above the P8 interlock (45% reactor power). The trip functions not tested are automatically bypassed and not testable above the P8 interlock, but below P8 are active and TSSR 4.3.1.1 is applicable. During the identified periods the completion time was not met. Since the condition was unrecognized, action was not taken, resulting in discrete periods of non-compliance with the TSAS. The subject Actuation Logic Tests have since been completed and test frequencies adjusted in the Surveillance Frequency Control Program to accommodate the RPS system design. All FU20 trip functions are operable and within approved surveillance frequencies. This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On 4/15/2021 FPL determined that RPS FU20, Automatic Trip and Interlock Logic, had not met TSSR 4.3.1.1. The Actuation Logic Tests (ALT) that apply to several trip functions, due to the design of the RPS [JC], were not being performed at the frequencies specified by the SFCP. The FU20 TSSRs include the ALTs as described in TS 4.3.3.1 Table 4.3-1, the 92-day (quarterly) frequencies for which are assigned by the SFCP. The affected FU20 trip functions tested by the ALTs and their respective power interlocks include: - Power Range Neutron Flux (low setpoint); <P10 (10% power) - Intermediate Range Neutron Flux; <P10 - Source Range Neutron Flux; <P6 (10E-5 cps) - Reactor Coolant Low Flow (2/3 loops); <P8 (45% power) - Reactor Coolant Pump Breaker Open (2/3 loops); <P8 The SFCP previously prescribed a quarterly frequency to the ALT for each of these trip functions. However, the design of the RPS is such that reactor power must be below the associated interlock of each trip function to perform the ALT. The subject ALTs are active below the P8 interlock (45% reactor power). When the reactors are operating at full power these trip functions are bypassed and the ALTs cannot be performed. If the ALT surveillance is past due and reactor power is maneuvered to a level below the corresponding interlock, such as for equipment maintenance or a scheduled outage, the TSSR is not met, rendering the FU20 channel inoperable. TS 3.3.1 Table 3.3-1 Action 8 directs shutdown to Mode 3 within 6 hours if a single channel is inoperable. In cases where both channels are inoperable TS 3.0.3 applies, also directing shutdown to Mode 3 within 6 hours. Since the condition was unrecognized, action pursuant to the TSAS was not taken, resulting in 5 discrete periods of TSAS non-compliance that occurred over the Past Operability Review (POR) assessment period. All of the periods of TS non-compliance during the assessment range occurred during power reductions of Units 3 and 4 for equipment maintenance or scheduled outages. Since there were no load reductions that went below 10% power and scheduled outages begin with a manual reactor trip from approximately 15% power, only the trip functions associated with the P8 (45%) interlock were non-compliant. This includes the Reactor Coolant Low Flow (2/3 loops) and RCP Breaker Open (2/3 loops) reactor trip functions. The evaluation concluded that the discrete periods of TS 3.3.1 or TS 3.0.3 non- compliance were as follows: Unit  Period  Ch A  Ch B  Applicable TS 3  9/30/18 04:41 - 10/1/18 00:02 (19 hrs 21 min)  X  X  TS 3.0.3 3  5/18/19 11:08 - 5/20/19 00:50 (37 hrs 42 min)  X  TS 3.3.1 3  9/26/19 20:54 - 9/27/19 19:31 (22 hrs 37 min)  X  X  TS 3.0.3 3  3/29/20 05:43 - 3/30/20 00:02 (18 hrs 19 min)  X  X  TS 3.0.3 4  3/10/19 05:45 - 3/11/19 00:02 (18 hrs 17 min)  X  X  TS 3.0.3 All FU20 ALT surveillances that could not be performed above their respective interlock power levels had been completed regularly during outage conditions, which is consistent with the design of the Turkey Point RPS. There were no failures during the surveillance testing and therefore no loss of safety function during the periods of TS non-compliance. At no point had any completed surveillance frequency exceeded an 18-month fuel cycle.",2502021002R00,2502021002R00,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications
,Unknown Unit,Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation due to Feedwater Isolation During Plant Shutdown,10/9/2021,"On 10/9/2021 at 03:00, with Unit 3 in Mode 3 at 0% power, an actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system occurred when level in the 3A Steam Generator increased to 80%, causing a Feedwater isolation signal, which tripped the running Steam Generator Feedwater Pump. The AFW system automatically started in response to the trip of the last running feedwater pump. All systems responded as designed to the 3A S/G high level condition. This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2) (iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in the auto-start of the AFW system.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On 10/9/21, while Unit 3 was in Mode 3 during a planned shutdown to commence the Cycle 32 refueling outage, with the 3B Steam Generator Feedwater Pump (SGFP) [SJ, P] in service, high level in the 3A Steam Generator (S/G) [SJ, SG] caused a feedwater isolation signal that tripped the 3B SGFP. The AFW [BA] system automatically actuated as designed in response to the trip of the last running SGFP. Since Unit 3 was in Mode 3 and reactor subcritical, feedwater supply to the S/Gs was aligned through the bypass feedwater flow control valves [SJ, FCV], with the 3B SGFP in operation. The 3A S/G main feedwater regulating valve FCV-3-478 [SJ, FCV] and the upstream motor-operated isolation valve MOV-3-1407 [SJ, 20] were fully closed. The bypass flow control valves were maintained in manual control as directed by the operating procedure. In response to a gradually increasing level trend in the 3A S/G that was initially identified at approximately 02:40am, adjustments were made to the 3A feedwater bypass flow control valve FCV-3-479 to reduce feedwater flow to the 3A S/G. By 02:50am, the feedwater bypass flow control valve was fully closed and feedwater flow and 3A S/G level continued to increase. At 02:54am the feedwater bypass isolation valve POV-3-477 [SJ, ISV] was fully closed to ensure that 3A S/G feedwater flow was positively secured through the bypass line. Feedwater flow and 3A S/G level continued to increase. At 02:56am level in the 3A S/G reached 80% narrow range, initiating a feedwater isolation signal that tripped the 3B SGFP. AFW automatically actuated in response to the trip of the last running SGFP. All systems responded as designed to the elevated level condition in the 3A S/G. The AFW system was subsequently secured and plant cooldown was continued in accordance with operating procedures. CAUSE The cause of the increasing level trend in the 3A S/G was seat leakage past the 3A S/G main feedwater regulating valve FCV-3-478 and upstream isolation valve MOV-3-1407. FCV-3-478 was overhauled. The plug, seat adapter, and seals were found degraded, consistent with extended service wear. The normal overhaul PM frequency for the feedwater regulating valves is every 4 refueling outages; however, the frequency for FCV-3-478 had been one-time extended to a 5th outage the previous cycle. The remaining feedwater regulating valves have remained on a 4-outage overhaul PM frequency. To support its primary function of feedwater isolation (no SGFP in operation), MOV-3-1407 closing torque is set up for condensate pump discharge pressure, which yields a significantly lower differential pressure across the valve seat than SGFP discharge pressure. This can result in the seating surface being less than fully sealed during normal Mode 3 operation when a SGFP is in service. Thus, seat leakage past MOV-3-1407 is expected given the deficiencies identified with FCV-3-478. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE This safety significance of this event was low. All systems and equipment operated as designed in response to high level in the 3A S/G. Reactor Coolant System cooldown remained within procedural limits.",2502021003R00,2502021003R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
,Unknown Unit,Through-Wall Leakage from Core Exit Thermocouple Tubing,11/12/2021,"On 11/12/2021 at 16:05, while Unit 3 was in Mode 3 at 0% power, through-wall leakage was verified from 3/8"" tubing associated with a Reactor Vessel Core Exit Thermocouple. The leakage was identified during the Class 1 leak inspection performed at Normal Operating Pressure and Temperature (NOP/NOT) conditions at the end of the Unit 3 Cycle 32 refueling outage. At 20:47, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A), FPL performed the 8-hour non-emergency notification to the NRCOC. Unit 3 was brought to Mode 5 and the repairs were completed. The Class 1 leak inspection was satisfactorily performed after NOP/NOT conditions were reestablished. Unit 3 has since been returned to service from the refueling outage and is operating at 100% power. This Licensee Event Report is required per 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(ii)(A).","EVENT DESCRIPTION On 11/12/2021 at approximately 05:00, while performing the Unit 3 Class 1 primary system leak inspection at Normal Operating Pressure and Temperature (NOP/NOT) conditions at the end of the Cycle 32 refueling outage, a small quantity of boric acid was observed on a section of 3/8"" stainless tubing associated with Core Exit Thermocouple (CET) 57. The boric acid was cleaned by the inspectors and no evidence of leakage was immediately evident. At 16:05 the area was re- inspected and boric acid was again present, indicating that a minor through-wall leakage flaw existed on the tubing. Unit 3 entered TS 3.4.6.2.a for Reactor Coolant system (RCS) pressure boundary leakage. An 8-hour notification (EN# 55574) was made to the NRCOC at 20:47 pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A). Unit 3 was brought to Mode 5 and the RCS was cooled and depressurized to establish proper maintenance conditions. The flawed section of tubing was removed, and both open ends of the remaining tubing were capped. The CET was abandoned in place. No other through-wall CET tubing flaws were identified. CAUSE The cause of the through-wall tube leakage is under investigation. The flawed tubing will be cleared for shipment and analyzed to determine the failure mechanism. A supplement to this LER will be submitted after a probable cause is determined. SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE This safety significance of this event was low. No safety system actuation was required. The through-wall leakage was non-quantifiable and well within RCS makeup capability. No safety margins were challenged or reduced. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Corrective Actions will be assigned following the cause investigation and will be described in the supplement to this LER. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION EIIS Codes are shown in the format [IEEE system identifier, component function identifier, second component function identifier (if appropriate)]. Analysis of the failed section of 3/8"" tubing is expected to be completed by April 2022. A supplement to this LER will be submitted after the appropriate cause investigation has been completed.

,Unknown Unit,Grid Disturbance in Switchyard Causes Automatic Reactor Trip,9/22/2023,"On September 22, 2023, with Unit 3 at 100% power, a grid disturbance caused by a lightning strike in the switchyard resulted in a generator lock out and subsequent turbine trip. The Reactor Protection System (RPS) automatically actuated as a result of the turbine trip. The automatic trip was uncomplicated with systems responding normally post-trip, including an expected Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) actuation. Subsequent analysis identified that due to the magnitude of the lightning strike, an induced voltage was created through the switchyard ground grid that arced across the relay contact that drives the string bus differential relay, resulting in a generator lockout. Corrective actions include replacement of the affected relay as well as a review of the ground grid and lightning protection scheme. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for any event or condition that resulted in the manual or automatic actuation of the RPS and AFW.","Description of Event On September 22, 2023, at 1819 EDT, with Unit 3 at 100% power, a grid disturbance in the switchyard [EIIS: FK] caused a contact [EIIS: 93] to be bypassed in the string bus differential relay [EIIS: 87]. This actuated a generator [EIIS: GEN] lockout, which then tripped the turbine {EIIS: TRB]. Upon the turbine trip, the RPS [EIIS: JE] automatically actuated. The trip was uncomplicated with systems responding normally, including the actuation of the AFW system [EIIS: BA] to remove decay heat. This is an expected condition after reactor trips. This licensee event report is being reported pursuant of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for any event or condition that resulted in the manual or automatic actuation of the RPS and AFW. In addition, there were no inoperable Structures, Systems, or Components that contributed to this event. Cause of Event The magnitude of the lightning strike caused a larger than normal voltage difference between the switchyard and plant ground grids. Because the string bus differential relay is tied to the switchyard ground system and the generator lockout is tied to the plant ground system, an induced voltage was created that arced across the differential relay contact. This initiated the generator lockout and ultimately the actuation of RPS. The was relay was manufactured by Westinghouse. Safety Significance The plant trip was uncomplicated with systems responding as expected post-trip. In response to the expected low steam generator level, emergency feedwater actuated as expected. This event did not result in a Safety System Functional Failure. Corrective Actions 1. The string bus differential relay has been replaced. 2.

The pressurizer [PZR] Power Operated Relief Valves (PORV) and their respective block valves are provided for plant operational flexibility and for limiting the number of challenges to the pressurizer safety valves. The normal source of motive power for PORVs is the plant nitrogen system [LK]. An accumulator in series with each PORV provides multiple cycles of operation if the nitrogen supply is lost. The alternate source of motive power is the instrument air system [LD]. If the nitrogen pressure to the valve operator falls below a preset value, instrument air is automatically aligned to the valve. The event described below is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B): ""Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications except when: (1) The Technical Specification is administrative in nature; (2) The event consisted solely of a case of a late surveillance test where the oversight was corrected, the test was performed, and the equipment was found to be capable of performing its specified safety functions; or (3) The Technical Specification was revised prior to discovery of the event such that the operation or condition was no longer prohibited at the time of discovery of the event."" This criterion requires a Licensee Event Report be submitted within 60 days of the event date. EVENT DESCRIPTION On June 12, 2023, at 16:41 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), a containment vessel [NH] entry was performed to identify a nitrogen leak in containment. The operator found the ""A"" Accumulator Low Pressure Safety Relief Valve [RV] lifting. PCV-3, Train ""A"" Nitrogen Regulator [RG] (Victor Model SR700MD (1/2"")), pressure indicated greater than 130 psig. The normal setpoint for PCV-3 is 90-95 psig. An attempt to adjust the regulator to the correct pressure was unsuccessful. This resulted in the decision to close OPP-25, Train ""A"" Isolation for nitrogen. Closure of OPP-25 resulted in isolation of the nitrogen line and nitrogen accumulator from pressurizer PORV PCV-456. Instrument air backup was still available. Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.11 was entered on June 14, 2023, at time 11:11 EDT to replace PCV-3. The PORV was returned to service and the LCO exited on June 14, 2023 at time 11:52 EDT. Upon further review, closure of OPP-25 isolated the nitrogen supply to the ""A"" PORV which resulted in the inability to meet Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.4.11.4 to verify accumulators are capable of operating a PORV through one complete cycle. Technical Specification (TS) LCO 3.4.11 Condition A should have been entered for an inoperable PORV. The required actions are to close and maintain power to the associated PORV block valve within one hour or, as required by TS LCO 3.4.11 Condition D, be in Mode 3 within six hours and Mode 4 in twelve hours. The failure to perform the TS required actions within the required completion time resulted in a condition prohibited by the TS which is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). CAUSAL FACTORS An incorrect conclusion was reached by Duke Energy licensed operators on applicability of TS 3.4.11. Specifically, it was not identified that isolating the nitrogen accumulator resulted in the inability to meet TS SR 3.4.11.4 to demonstrate the accumulators are capable of supplying sufficient nitrogen to operate the PORVs. A contributing factor to this event is that Operations Work Procedure OWP-016, Safety Injection System, includes a Precaution that inaccurately states: ""Isolating Nitrogen to the PORVs has no impact on Tech Spec operability of the PORVs or plant risk profile provided the PORVs are supplied by Instrument Air as a backup motive force and the PORVs can be cycled manually"". This contributed to the operators' decision on applicability of TS 3.4.11.",2612023001R00,2612023001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications

This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).","Description of the Event: At 1646 on July 31, 2021, with Unit 1 operating in MODE 1 at full power, Operators removed Unit 1 from service by manually tripping the reactor [AC] when operators identified control board indications warranting prompt removal of the reactor from service. All control rods [JD] fully inserted into the core due to the manual trip. The auxiliary feedwater system [BA] started as expected when a valid system actuation occurred after the reactor trip. There was no emergency core cooling system actuation [JE] and offsite power [FK] was maintained throughout the event. After the reactor trip, a condenser steam dump valve [JI] cycled and did not fully close. The valve was locally isolated to prevent additional reactor [AC] cooldown. After the turbine trip, the crossover steam dump system motor operated valves [SE] did not close. This caused main condenser [SG] vacuum conditions to deteriorate. This lead to main condenser unavailability and the use of the atmospheric steam dump system. Field action was taken to close the crossover steam dump valves. Additionally, during the feedwater transition, the main feedwater B regulating bypass valve [JB] did not control in automatic and was taken to manual control. This 60-day licensee event report is being submitted in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). Cause of the Event: The cause of the manual reactor trip was due to the failure of main steam generator feedwater (SGFW) pump B motor [EA][MO]. The root cause has been determined to be less than adequate manufacturing process controls for the stator and rotor assembly. A misalignment between the stator and rotor resulted in periodic contact of the rotor to stator eventually degrading the iron laminations and winding insulation to the point of failure of the stator winding. The condenser steam dump valve [JI] condition was caused by the failure of its positioner [TC]. The crossover steam dump valve [SE] condition was caused by the failure of a relay [RLY], and the feedwater regulating valve condition will be investigated further during the next available opportunity. Analysis of the Event: The feedwater system is comprised of two half-capacity main SGFW pumps that deliver fluid to the secondary side of the steam generators. The fluid is used to remove the heat generated in the reactor and to produce steam used for electrical power generation. The loss of the main SGFW pump motor required an immediate reduction in reactor power to support the limitations of a single train of feedwater. At the time of the failure the reactor power was not low enough to support removal of one of the two operating main SGFW pumps, which necessitated a manual reactor trip. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps started as expected on low steam generator level experienced due to reducing steam demand from the turbine trip in response to the reactor trip. After the reactor trip, all control rods fully inserted in the core due to the manual trip. There was no Emergency Core Cooling System actuation. Offsite power was maintained throughout the event. The equipment anomalies that occurred did not affect safety system functions. Corrective Actions: The anomalies experienced during the shutdown were diagnosed, and those requiring maintenance prior to reactor restart were completed. The reactor was returned to service at reduced power and the main SGFW pump motor was replaced",2662021001R00,2662021001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section

Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) The non-essential Service Water (SW) automatic isolation function ensures adequate intake canal inventory can be maintained by the emergency service water pumps following a design basis accident. This is accomplished using intake canal level probes which will isolate the non-essential equipment once the canal level drops below a predetermined level. On 3/22/2022 during routine testing, 2 of the 4 probes failed their response time test. The probes were cleaned, retested satisfactory, and returned to service. The cause of the test failure was determined to be biofouling. There were no safety consequences since an engineering analysis concluded that the intake canal level and inventory would have been sufficient to support all accident analysis assumptions.  Planned corrective actions include increased testing to monitor the biofouling buildup and the continued testing of probe coatings to reduce the biofouling. This event is being reported as a condition prohibited by the stations' Technical Specifications and a common cause failure.

Surry Power Station Unit 1 280 2022 001 00 NARRATIVE Plant Operating Conditions Prior to the Event Both units operating at 100% 1.0 Description of Event The non-essential Service Water (SW) automatic isolation function [EMS: JE, KG] ensures adequate intake canal inventory can be maintained by the emergency service water pumps [EllS: BI, P] following a design basis loss of coolant accident (LOCA) with a coincident loss of offsite power (LOOP). This function is designed to actuate when any three of the four intake canal level probes [EIIS: JE, LE] sense water level drop from the normal 28-foot level past a fixed level point of 23.5 feet. The probes are required to actuate in 55 seconds or less to ensure that the automatic logic initiates prior to the intake canal level dropping to 23 feet under all design basis scenarios. The 23-foot level is the initial condition used in the accident analyses. The four (4) intake canal level probes are routinely cleaned and inspected from April to October. This is based on the typical period that the colonial hydroids grow in the service water system, plus some buffer time on either side of that time range. Typically, the probes are found clean during the April and May cleanings and found clean in the September and October cleanings. Although there is some variance from year to year, in general, this cleaning period has worked best for the discovery and removal of colonial hydroids. On 3/22/2022, the 18-month channel 1 and channel 4 [EMS: JE, CHA] intake canal level probe calibrations were both scheduled. They were scheduled and performed sequentially. Both probes had been installed approximately 18 months earlier (channel 1 on 7/10/2020 and channel 4 on 7/15/2020). The channel 1 probe was tested first and produced an as found response time of 106 seconds. This was greater than the 55 second acceptance criteria. The probe was inspected and cleaned per the calibration procedure. Minimal fouling was noted (recorded as 0%-5% and hydroid-free). The actuation settings were checked per the calibration procedure. No adjustments were made, and no problems were found. The probe was retested in accordance with the calibration procedure and produced a satisfactory response time of 38 seconds. Following this completed calibration, the channel 4 probe was tested, with an as-found response time of 119 seconds. The probe was inspected and cleaned per the calibration procedure. Minimal fouling was noted (also recorded as 0%-5% and hydroid-free). The actuation settings were checked per the calibration procedure. No adjustments were made, and no problems were found. The probe was retested in accordance with the procedure and had a satisfactory response time of 53 seconds. Since a satisfactory response time was obtained on each probe with no actions performed, other than the cleaning, it was concluded that the slow time response on each probe was due to the common cause of biofouling. Since biofouling is a phenomenon that requires a period of a few days to become established, it is likely that the biofouling existed on both probes for a period exceeding 72 hours prior to the test.

The channel 3 probe had been time response tested with satisfactory results (10-15 seconds) on 3/2/2022. The channel 2 probe was time response tested with satisfactory results (17 seconds) on 4/19/2022. Reportability A review of each individual probe test (on 3/22/2022) showed that in both cases, the Technical Specification (TS) actions taken were appropriate based on a time of discovery failure determination. However, when the tests are taken in aggregate and assessed against the reporting requirements delineated in NUREG-1022, Rev. 3, ""Event Report Guidelines 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73,"" it was concluded that both probes were likely inoperable prior to their time of discovery and that the station had operated in a condition prohibited by the TS; Consequently, this report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). This report is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) as a common cause inoperability of independent trains or channels, i.e., a single cause resulted in two independent probe channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. 2.0 Significant Safety Consequences and Implications To determine the potential impact of the slow time response on the non-essential SW automatic isolation function, Engineering performed an evaluation to determine the intake canal minimum level that would have resulted from the slow time responses measured on 3/22/2022. This evaluation assessed the operating conditions present during the interval from the last cleaning (10/5/2021) to the time of the calibration tests (3/22/2022). The analysis concluded that the intake canal level and inventory would have been sufficient to support all accident analysis assumptions even if all four probes were conservatively assumed to actuate at the slowest of the four as found measured response times. In other words, the non-essential service water would have isolated prior to the intake canal level dropping below the assumed initial condition level of 23 feet. Additionally, intake canal level is also monitored by an independent system that provides level indication and high/low level alarms in the main control room. In the event of loss of intake canal level, station procedures direct corrective/ mitigative actions, including isolation of non-essential SW. In summary, this event resulted in no safety consequences or significant implications and the health and safety of the public was not affected at any time. 3.0 Cause of the Event Since both intake canal level probes produced a satisfactory response time with no actions other than being cleaned, it has been concluded that the cause of the event was due to the material that was removed when cleaned. Observations indicate a muddy film that is suspected of being biofouling noted on both probes.

Surry Power Station,1,Failure of Unit 1 Emercency Diesel Generator Results in an Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications,7/25/2022,"On July 25, 2022, with both Surry Power Station Units 1 and 2 at 100% power, the 7-day Technical Specification (TS) Allowed Outage Time (AOT) for an emergency diesel generator (EDG) was exceeded due to a partial loss of load during monthly surveillance testing for the Unit 1 emergency diesel generator (EDG-1), requiring repair and restoration. To complete the EDG-1 repair, balancing, testing, and return to service, a request for enforcement discretion was submitted and approved that extended the TS AOT by two days (for a total of nine days). During event troubleshooting, it was revealed that the cause was corrosion between the lugs of the field lead causing a hard ground on one pole of the generator rotor. The risk analysis performed for this event concluded that the increase in core damage and large early release probability remained within the NRC Enforcement Manual, Appendix F limits. Completed corrective actions included the replacement of the EDG-1 generator and verification of operability of the EDG-2 and EDG-3.","PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT Surry Power Station (SPS) Unit 1 and Unit 2 were at 100% power. 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT The SPS emergency diesel generator (EDG) [EIIS: DG] for Unit 1 (EDG-1) and Unit 2 EDG (EDG-2) are dedicated to emergency buses 1H and 2H [EllS: BU], respectively. A third diesel generator (EDG-3) is provided as a ""swing diesel"" and is shared by both units (the ""J"" bus). Each EDG has 100% capacity and is connected to an independent 4160 V emergency bus. EDG-1 provides emergency power to certain equipment and systems common to Units 1 and 2, including the Auxiliary Feedwater system (AFW) [EllS: BA] cross-tie between Units 1 and 2, the Auxiliary building [EIIS: NF] filter exhaust fan [EIIS: FAN], Main Control Room (MCR) [EIIS: NA] chiller [EIIS: CHU], and MCR/Emergency Switchgear Room [EIIS: EK] filtered supply fans [EllS: FAN]. At 0956 on July 18, 2022, the SPS EDG-1 for Unit 1 was removed from service to perform the monthly surveillance test. Approximately 20 minutes after reaching full load, EDG-1 experienced a partial loss of load. The MCR operators noted that the generator load had lowered and the generator output current indication was above the normal amps for fully loaded. Local field operators noted a change in engine sound normally associated with decreasing load; subsequently, EDG-1 was unloaded and ran unloaded for 30 minutes before being secured in accordance with the normal shutdown sequence. Following shutdown, EDG-1 was removed from service for investigation. Troubleshooting was performed, and it was discovered that a lead to the generator exciter [EIIS: EXC] was grounded. A physical inspection of this lead revealed a failure between the generator brush rigging and the panel wiring at the bolted connection point. A bridge and megger check on the generator stator was satisfactory. Further troubleshooting of the generator rotor indicated a hard ground on one out of eight (8) rotor poles. It was concluded that repairs to EDG-1 were necessary, including replacement of the generator. During the return-to- service testing portion of the repair effort, activities required to complete the repair, perform post-maintenance testing, and return the SPS Unit 1 EDG-1 to service would not be accomplished within the 7-day Allowed Outage Time (AOT) (reference: TS 3.16.6.1.a.3 for an inoperable EDG), and as such, a request for enforcement discretion was requested and verbally approved on July 24, 2022, at 14:27. This enforcement discretion allowed a 2-day extension to the 7-day AOT to complete the EDG-1 return to service activities. TS 3.16.B.1.a.3 requires an inoperable EDG to be restored to service within seven (7) days or action be initiated to place the appropriate unit in a shutdown condition. In addition, TS 3.0.2 states that TS action statements associated with any individual systems, subsystems, trains, components, and devices that EDG-1 supports also would be governed by the 7- day EDG AOT. Since EDG-1 provides emergency power to certain equipment and systems common to Units 1 and 2, the shutdown of Unit 2 also would be required upon the expiration of the EDG-1, 7-day AOT. During final return-to-service testing, at 0956 on July 25, 2022, with both Surry Power Station (SPS) Unit 1 and Unit 2 at 100% power, the AOT for TS 3.16.B.1.a.3 was exceeded for Unit 1. Additionally, TS 3.0.2 for Unit 2 was not satisfied due to the inoperability of EDG-1 beyond that allowed by TS 3.16.6.1.a.3. Both units remained at 100% power throughout the restoration of EDG-1 that was declared operable at 1705 on July 26, 2022.

Surry Power Station,1,Loss of Emergency Switchgear Room Cooling Due to Use of Incorrect Air Handler Fan V-Belts,9/15/2022,"As part of planned maintenance beginning on 7/29/2022 to 9/15/2022, the air handling unit (AHU) fan V-belts for both of the Unit 1 Emergency Switchgear Room (ESGR) cooling trains (1-VS-AC-6 and 1-VS-AC-7) were replaced. When the AHU was placed in-service, these V-belts eventually failed resulting in the inoperability of one or both of the AHU(s). The cause of this event was that the V-belt vendor sent a different variant of the BX-99 V-belt ordered (Torq Titan vs. the Grip Notch V-belt expected) and these belts were inadvertently accepted and installed at the station. Contributing to this cause was that there were missed opportunities to recognize that the new V-belts were not the same design as those being replaced. There were no safety consequences because of this event since the maximum temperature in the room stayed well below the design basis upper limit. Planned corrective actions include procedural enhancements and coaching of personnel to ensure that the parts received at the station comply with those ordered.","PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT Surry Power Station (SPS) Units 1 and 2 were at 100% power. 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT (EIIS codes are identified in the text as [XX]) The Main Control Room/Emergency Switchgear Room (MCR/ESGR) ventilation subsystem [VK] provides fresh air and recirculates and cools the air for personnel and equipment concerns, and the emergency portion of the system supplies provide a source of filtered fresh air to these areas in the event of a nuclear or chemical release. Air conditioning (A/C), breathing air, and associated equipment are Seismic Class I within the missile-protected boundary and powered from emergency buses to ensure operation during both normal and emergency conditions. Two (2) 100% redundant air handling units (AHUs) [AHU], fed from different power sources, are provided for the ESGR and Relay Room (RR) of each unit. Each AHU is supplied chilled water by one of five chillers [CHU] connected to the same power source as the respective AHU. For the AHU fan [FAN], there are two (2) matched rubber V-belts installed. The system is designed to limit temperatures in occupied spaces to less than 100Ã‚Â°F and in non-occupied spaces to less than 120Ã‚Â°F. The AHUs, which serve the Unit 1 ESGR, are 1-VS-AC-6 (powered from the 1J bus) and 1-VS-AC-7 (powered from the 1H bus). The design basis of the MCR and ESGR air conditioning system (ACS) [ACU] is to maintain the MCR/ESGR envelope temperature within the equipment design limits for 30 days of continuous occupancy after a design basis accident (DBA). The ACS includes five (5) chillers (1-VS-E-4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and 4E). The chillers supply chilled water to eight (8) AHUs arranged in two (2) independent and redundant chilled water loops. On 7/29/2022, as part of planned preventative maintenance on the ESGR AHUs, the V-belts on 1-VS-AC-7 were replaced with the same stock number V-belts that have been in-service at Surry Power Station (SPS) for many years. However, the AHU was not placed in-service until 9/14/2022. At that time, SPS personnel were unaware that the V-belts installed had been replaced by the manufacturer from the ?Å“old style??Grip Notch V-belts to the ?Å“new-style??Torq Titan V-belts. On 9/16/2022, 1-VS-AC-7 was secured due to a belt slapping noise. An investigation revealed that one of the two belts had come off the sheaves. A new set of Torq Titan V-belts was installed and tensioned after a satisfactory alignment and sheave check were performed. On 9/15/2022, preventative maintenance was performed on 1-VS-AC-6 that also installed the new Torq Titan V-belts. Those V-belts failed on 9/17/2022 and were replaced with another set of Torq Titan V-belts after an alignment and sheave check. At this point SPS believed issues with both AHUs had been corrected. On 9/18/2022, the V-belts on 1-VS-AC-7 failed again and were replaced with Torq Titan V-belts. This time an alignment check was performed using a laser alignment tool and the belts were ?Å“run in??for four (4) hours, followed by satisfactory vibration readings prior to returning the AHU to operable status.",2802022003R00,2802022003R00,"50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(A), 50.73.(a)(2)(vii)",,
Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant,1,12 Diesel Driven Cooling Water Pump Auto Start Due to Low System Pressure,1/26/2021,"On January 26, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP), 12 Diesel Driven Cooling Water Pump (DDCLP) auto started. Maintenance was in progress on 22 DDCLP and 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) was aligned as the replacement safety related pump for 22 DDCLP while non-safety related 21 Cooling Water (CL) pump was supporting the system loads. The 12 DDCLP auto started on a sensed low header pressure following the isolation of 22 Cooling Water Strainer for maintenance and subsequent auto initiation of backwash of the other Cooling Water Strainers. This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation. There were no nuclear safety impacts. The system operated as designed. All systems responded normally. The direct cause of this event was low pressure at the discharge of 12 DDCLP due to the isolation of the Cooling Water Strainer while 22 DDCLP was isolated during low CL system flow conditions. The corrective actions included securing the 12 DDCLP. In addition, procedure updates are planned.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 26, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP), Units 1 and Unit 2, were both in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at 100 percent power. The total Cooling Water (CL) system operating flow rates were in the range that operation of only one CL pump was desired. Non-safety related train B 21 CL Pump was supporting all the CL system loads for both trains of CL while the train B 22 Diesel Driven Cooling Water Pump (DDCLP) was out of service for maintenance and the 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) was aligned as the train B replacement safety- related pump. At 1044 CST, the train A 12 DDCLP auto started on a sensed low header pressure following the isolation of 22 Cooling Water Strainer for maintenance and subsequent auto initiation of backwash of the other Cooling Water Strainers which reduced system pressure slightly. The 12 DDCLP is designed to start automatically if the CL discharge header pressure drops to 75 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for 15 seconds. This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation per NUREG 1022, Revision 3. EVENT ANALYSIS The 12 DDCLP is a part of the PINGP CL System (EIIS CODE: BI). The CL system is a ring header which is shared by Units 1 and 2 that provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operational heat from safety-related components during a design basis accident or transient. During normal and shutdown operation, the CL system also provides this function for various safety-related and non-safety related components. The CL system consists of a common CL pump discharge header for five CL pumps: two non-safety related pumps, two safety related DDCLPs, and 121 MDCLP that can be aligned as replacement for either DDCLP by realigning its power supply and administratively disabling the CL pump discharge header valves to direct flow to the appropriate train. With 121 MDCLP replacing 22 DDCLP on train B, the operating 21 CL pump supplied the ring header via train B and back fed to train A, creating a lower pressure at the discharge of 12 DDCLP than what is indicated in the control room. The isolation of 22 Cooling Water Strainer and subsequent auto backwash of the other Cooling Water strainers further reduced pressure to the 12 DDCLP auto start setpoint. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES The auto start of 12 DDCLP did not challenge nuclear safety as all plant systems responded as designed. This event does not represent a safety system functional failure for Unit 1 or Unit 2. There were no radiological, environmental, or industrial impacts associated with this event. The health and safety of the public and site personnel were not impacted during this event. CAUSE OF THE EVENT The direct cause of this event was low pressure at the discharge of 12 DDCLP due to the isolation of the Cooling Water Strainer while 22 DDCLP was isolated during low CL system flow conditions. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Operations restored CL system pressure by returning 22 CL Strainer to service, securing 12 DDCLP, and operating 11 CL pump through the duration of the 22 DDCLP maintenance. Procedure updates to perform mitigating actions while performing DDCLP and Cooling Water Strainer maintenance is a planned corrective action.

Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant,1,Loss of Electrical Bus Results in 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump Auto Start,10/17/2021,"On October 17, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) 2RY Transformer was de-energized when operations personnel opened the 2RSY Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch instead of closing the 2RSX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch during restoration of the 2RX Transformer in the substation. The de-energization of 2RY caused a loss of power to the Unit 2 4.16 KV Bus 23. This led to an auto-start of 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump on a sensed low header pressure. This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation. Outage Shutdown Safety Assessment and Probability Risk Assessment remained green during the event and recovery actions. The cause of the de-energization of 2RY was individual errors during hard match and concurrent verification. The corrective action implemented required all substation switching to be identified as high risk with field supervisor oversight required.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 17, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP), Unit 1 was in Mode 1 (Power Operation) at 100 percent power and Unit 2 was in Mode 6 (Refueling) at 0 percent power. The 2RY Reserve Auxiliary Transformer was supplying Safety Related 4.16 KV Bus 25 and the Non-Safety Related 4.16 KV Buses 23 and 24. At 1601 CDT, the 2RY Reserve Auxiliary Transformer was de-energized when operations personnel opened the 2RSY Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch instead of closing the 2RSX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch during restoration of the 2RX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer in the substation. The de-energization of 2RY caused a loss of power to the Unit 2 Buses 23, 24, and 25. Automatic reenergization of Bus 25 via CT12 Transformer, the other offsite power source, occurred. Bus 23 supplies power to Non-Safety Related 21 Cooling Water (CL) pump, which was supporting all the CL system loads. Following the trip of 21 CL Pump, 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) auto started on a sensed low header pressure. The 121 MDCLP is designed to start automatically if CL header pressure drops to 80 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). EVENT ANALYSIS 121 MDCLP The 121 MDCLP is a part of the PINGP CL System (EIIS CODE: BI). The CL system is a ring header which is shared by Units 1 and 2 that provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operational heat from safety-related components during a design basis accident or transient.

The total Cooling Water (CL) system operating flow rates were in the range that operation of only one CL pump for both Units was desired. The ring header valves were open and 121 MDCLP was not aligned as a replacement for either DDCLP. The trip of 21 CL Pump resulted in a reduction in header pressure to the 121 MDCLP auto start setpoint. This event is reportable per 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Emergency Service Water system actuation. Human Performance PINGP Non-Licensed Operators (NLOs) were performing their first-time evolution of the tasks of restoring the 2RX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer in the switchyard during the Unit 2 Refueling Outage. After successful closure of the 2RSX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV A Disconnect Switch, the NLOs opened the 2RSY Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch instead of closing the 2RSX Reserve Auxiliary Transformer 34.5KV B Disconnect Switch. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES Outage Shutdown Safety Assessment (SSA) and Probability Risk Assessment (PRA) remained green during the event and subsequent recovery actions. The auto start of 121 MDCLP did not challenge nuclear safety as the Cooling Water system responded as designed. This event does not represent a safety system functional failure for Unit 1 or Unit 2.

Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant,1,"Reactor trip, Auxiliary Feedwater and Emergency Service Water system actuation due to electrical transient in DC control power cables",10/19/2023,"At 11:10 on October 19, 2023, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Unit 1 operating at 100 percent power in Mode 1, power operations, multiple substation breakers unexpectedly opened and multiple grounds were detected on DC control power cabling from the plant to the substation control house. This resulted in a Unit 1 Turbine Trip and subsequent Reactor Trip with a loss of all non-safety related busses and the actuation of Auxiliary Feedwater and Emergency Service Water. Operators responded to the event in accordance with approved procedures and safely placed the plant in Mode 3. Horizontal directional drilling in progress at the site damaged DC control cables resulting in the identified plant response. This was caused by weakness in the Excavation Permit approval process as well as inadequate oversight of the personnel performing the work. DC cable replacement has been completed and multiple procedure changes have been initiated to address the identified gaps and prevent recurrence of this event. There were no radiological impacts from the event. The health and safety of the public and site personnel were not impacted during this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a Reactor Trip, a valid Auxiliary Feedwater actuation of Emergency Service Water system.","Plant Operating Conditions Prior to the Event: Unit 1 - Mode 1, 100 percent Power Unit 2 - Defueled EVENT DESCRIPTION At 11:10 on October 19, 2023, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) Unit 1 operating at 100 percent power and Unit 2 defueled in a scheduled refueling outage, multiple substation breakers, including the Unit 1 generator output breaker, unexpectedly opened causing a Unit 1 Turbine [TA] Trip and subsequent Reactor Trip. In addition, multiple grounds were detected on DC control cabling for both Units from the plant to the substation control house. The Turbine Trip caused 1M Main Transformer to become deenergized, which is the normal power supply to non-safety related (NSR) busses on Unit 1. 1R Auxiliary Transformer was also deenergized as a result of the event and therefore was not available for a Fast Bus Transfer, which resulted in a loss of all NSR busses on both Units. The reactor trip resulted in Steam Generator Water Level (SGWL) in both Steam Generators rapidly shrinking to below the setpoint for an automatic start of both Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[BA] pumps. These pumps ensure that at least one Steam Generator contains enough water to serve as the heat sink for reactor decay heat and sensible heat removal following a reactor trip. Both the 11 Turbine Driven AFW Pump and 12 Motor Driven AFW Pump actuated upon reaching the automatic start setpoint for low SGWL. The 121 Motor Driven Cooling Water Pump (MDCLP) auto started on low header pressure due to the loss of the NSR 11 Cooling Water (CL) Pump. The 121 MDCLP is designed to start automatically if CL header pressure drops to 80 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The 121 MDCLP is a part of the PINGP Cooling Water (CL) System [BI]. The CL system is a ring header which is shared by Units 1 and 2 that provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operational heat from safety-related components during a design basis accident or transient. At 14:15 on October 19, 2023, Event Notification (EN) # 56803 was reported to the NRC as a 4-hour Non-Emergency report under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) actuation of the reactor protection system and 8-Hr Non-Emergency report under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for an Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES All control rods were fully inserted into the core following the trip. All safety functions operated as designed. This event does not represent a safety system functional failure for Unit 1 or Unit 2. AFW actuated as expected. The AFW System automatically supplied feedwater to the Steam Generators to remove decay heat from the Reactor Coolant System when SGWL shrunk after the reactor trip.

Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant,2,22 Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Actuation Signal Due to Procedure Error,10/3/2021,"On October 3, 2021, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) Unit 2 in Cold Shutdown, the 22 Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pump received a valid actuation signal. While performing the prerequisite checklists for Surveillance Procedure (SP) 2083A ?Å“Unit 2 Integrated SI Test with a Simulated Loss of Offsite Power Train A,??the Train B 22 Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pump selector switch in the Main Control Room was placed in Shutdown Auto from Manual. This, combined with having the Non-Safety Related 4160 Volt buses 21 and 22 isolated for maintenance, completed the automatic start signal. The turbine and pump did not turn because the equipment was out of service with the steam supply valves closed. This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Pressurized Water Reactor Auxiliary Feedwater actuation signal. There was no impact on the ability to maintain safe shutdown conditions. The system operated as designed. The cause of this event was a latent procedure error in SP 2083A. The corrective action was an update to the SP 2083A prerequisite checklist to place the 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump selector switch to Manual.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 3, 2021, the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) Unit 2 was in Mode 5, Cold Shutdown, at 0 percent power with Non-Safety Related 4160 Volt buses 21 and 22 isolated for maintenance. At 1525 CDT, the 22 Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pump received an unplanned actuation signal while performing the prerequisite checklists of Surveillance Procedure (SP) 2083A ?Å“Unit 2 Integrated SI Test with a Simulated Loss of Offsite Power Train A??when the 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump selector switch in the Main Control Room was placed in Shutdown Auto from Manual. This event is reportable under 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a valid Pressurized Water Reactor Auxiliary Feedwater actuation signal, per NUREG 1022, Revision 3. EVENT ANALYSIS The 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump is a part of the PINGP AFW System (EIIS CODE: BA). The AFW System automatically supplies feedwater to the steam generators (SG) to remove decay heat from the Reactor Coolant System upon the loss of normal feedwater supply. The AFW system is configured into two redundant trains. One train has a turbine driven AFW pump; the other has a motor driven AFW pump. One automatic start signal for the turbine driven AFW Pump is the loss of both non-safety related 4160 Volt buses that provide power to the Main Feedwater (MFW) pumps. A loss of power for both MFW pumps will start the turbine driven AFW pump to ensure that at least one SG contains enough water to serve as the heat sink for reactor decay heat and sensible heat removal following the reactor trip. With Non-Safety Related 4160 Volt buses 21 and 22 isolated for maintenance, placing the 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump selector switch in Shutdown Auto completed the automatic start signal causing the associated 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump Steam Block Valve to open. The turbine and pump did not turn because the equipment was out of service with the steam supply valves closed. The 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump Steam Block Valve then returned to the closed position on a Low Pump discharge pressure signal. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES The actuation signal for the 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump did not challenge the ability to maintain safe shutdown conditions. There were no radiological, environmental, or industrial impacts associated with this event. The health and safety of the public and site personnel were not impacted during this event. CAUSE OF THE EVENT The cause of this event was a latent procedure error in SP 2083A from when the procedure was changed from testing both trains of the system to testing each of the trains separately. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Operations updated the SP 2083A prerequisite checklist to place the 22 Turbine Driven AFW Pump selector switch to Manual.

Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant,2,2GT/XFMR lockout due to failure of lightning arrester caused Unit 2 Reactor Trip,5/27/2023,"At 18:19 on May 27, 2023, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Unit 2 operating at approximately 100% power and steady-state operation, Unit 2 Generator Transformer (2GT/XFMR) lockout occurred causing the turbine and subsequently reactor to trip. Operators responded to the event in accordance with approved procedures and safely placed the plant in Mode 3. The direct cause of this event was the failure of the A-phase lightning arrester on 2GT/XFMR. The failed arrester was sent out for a failure analysis to be performed by a third-party laboratory. May 27, 2023 at 19:20 Event Notification (EN) # 56543 was reported to the NRC as a 4-hour notification under 10 CFR 50.72(b) (2)(iv)(B) actuation of the reactor protection system and a Notification of Unusual Event.

A Notification of Unusual Event was declared based on multiple fire alarms in the containment building that were not verified within 15 minutes. At 18:45, there was verification of no fire in the containment building. Termination of the Notification of Unusual Event occurred at 23:04. This event was reported to the NRC on May 27, 2023 at 19:20 in Event Notification (EN) number 56543, as a 4-hour notification under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) actuation of the reactor protection system.

An outplant operator was in the vicinity of the 2GT/XFMR at the time of the trip and noted a loud noise and smoke from the transformer. Visual inspection of A-phase lightning arrester [LAR] showed evidence of arcing present between the top and bottom stack. This was corroborated by security camera footage revealing a bright flash and ensuing smoke emanating from a 2GT/XFMR lightning arrester. Troubleshooting determined the most likely cause of the 2GT/XFMR lockout to be failure of the A-phase lightning arrester. The failed lightning arrester shorted to ground causing a correct actuation of protective relaying, specifically instantaneous overcurrent and short to ground that led to the lockout of the 2GT/XFMR transformer. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to a reactor trip and an AFW actuation signal. Unit 1 was not affected during this event and remained at 100% power.

Essential Service Water cross-tie valves [BI][A were closed by operators at 1154, exiting LCO 3.8.1 AC Sources ??Operating, Condition D. Initial investigations by station staff found no external visual abnormalities near either unit's RATs or in the switchyard. Transformer 1-TR101AB and 2-TR201AB Phase 1 Lead Differential Relay 12-87-TABLD-1 [EA][87] was found tripped. A clearance for reserve feed power was implemented to facilitate additional testing and inspections. Oil samples were obtained and tested from the RATs and indicated satisfactory results. Tan Delta testing was performed of the Phase A cables from the switchyard to the 12AB Loop Feed Enclosure and from the 12AB Loop Feed Enclosure to the RATs with satisfactory results. The 12AB Loop Feed Enclosure upper bus was megger tested with unsatisfactory results. A borescope visual inspection of the upper bus duct was performed and indicated physical evidence of an electrical fault. After removing the top of the upper bus duct, a visual inspection of the inside portion revealed signs of a phase to ground fault and indications of arc tracking along the insulating boots. Additionally, there was evidence of insulator contamination and moisture within the enclosure. Due to the extensive troubleshooting time required to identify the cause of the problem and the scope of repairs, enforcement discretion was requested to allow exceeding the 72 hour completion time of Required Action A.3 of Technical Specification 3.8.1 AC Sources ??Operating, by an additional 48 hours to complete repairs. Without enforcement discretion, Unit 1 and Unit 2 were required to be in MODE 3 by 0408 on March 1, 2021, and Mode 5 by 1008 on March 2, 2021. Enforcement discretion (EA-21-04; ADAMS Accession Number: ML21063A568) was granted per phone conversation, for an additional 48 hours on February 28, 2021, which would expire on March 3, 2021 at 1008. Temporary heaters were installed at the 12AB and 12CD Loop Feed Enclosures, to prevent condensation of moisture inside of the enclosures. The faulted bus was splice-repaired, successfully post-maintenance tested, and the loop feed enclosure was re-terminated. Power was restored and Train B Reserve Feed was declared operable and exited the LCO on March 2, 2021, at 0522 within the period of enforcement discretion.

Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant,1,Manual Reactor Trip Following Manual Turbine Trip due to High Vibrations on Main Turbine,5/24/2022,"On May 24, 2022, at 0414 EDT, Donald C. Cook Unit 1 was operating at approximately 12 percent power, while emerging from the Unit 1 Cycle 31 refueling outage (U1C31) which included significant maintenance on the Unit 1 High Pressure Turbine. While rolling the Unit 1 Main Turbine, it experienced high vibrations due to an apparent rub, and was manually tripped. Following the Main Turbine trip, the high vibrations persisted, and the Unit 1 Reactor was manually tripped, the Main Steam Stop Valves were closed, and main condenser vacuum was broken. Following the reactor trip, Unit 1 continued to be supplied by offsite power. All control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps started as required and operated properly, no Safety Injection actuation was initiated or required, and Decay Heat Removal was through the Unit 1 Steam Generator Power-Operated Relief Valves (SG PORVs). All required equipment operated as expected, and the trip was not complicated. The initiating event for the Unit 1 Manual Reactor Trip was to allow the control room operators to break Main Condenser vacuum and prevent further potential damage to the Main Turbine due to the high vibrations. The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the manual reactor trip.","INTRODUCTION On May 24, 2022, at 0414 EDT, Donald C. Cook Unit 1 was operating at approximately 12 percent power, while emerging from the Unit 1 Cycle 31 refueling outage (U1C31) which included significant maintenance on the Unit 1 High Pressure Turbine [TA][TRB]. While rolling the Unit 1 Main Turbine, it experienced high vibrations due to an apparent rub, and was manually tripped. Following the Main Turbine trip, the high vibrations persisted, and the Unit 1 Reactor [RCT] was manually tripped, the Main Steam Stop Valves [SB][ISV] were closed, and main condenser vacuum was broken. Due to the significant amount of maintenance done on the Main Turbine, the potential for a turbine trip and/or a reactor trip was anticipated as part of the startup preparations. All required equipment operated as expected, and the trip was not complicated. Following the reactor trip, Unit 1 continued to be supplied by offsite power. All control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps [BA][P] started as required and operated properly, and no Safety Injection actuation was initiated or required. During the event, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature initially lowered, as expected and was stabilized at approximately 550 degrees F by the Steam Generator Power-Operated Relief Valves (SG PORVs) [SB][RV], after the Main Steam Stop Valves were closed. EVENT DESCRIPTION The Main Turbine had been tripped twice the previous day. The first trip occurred on May 23, 2022 at 0620, with the turbine at 500 rpm, due to excessive eccentricity and rising vibration, and the second trip occurred on May 23. 2022 at 1420, with the turbine at 1800 rpm, due to elevated thrust bearing temperature. The generator was not connected to the grid prior to these turbine trips, and in both cases, the reactor remained critical since the turbine trip occurred below P-8. The Power Range Neutron Flux (P-8) interlock is actuated at approximately 29% power as determined by two-out-of-four Nuclear Instrumentation System (NIS) Power Range Detectors. The P-8 interlock automatically enables the reactor trip on Turbine Trip (Low Fluid Oil Pressure and Turbine Stop Valve Closure) on increasing power. At 0332 on May 24, 2022, control room operators rolled the Main Turbine a third time. At 0403, the turbine was tripped at 1221 rpm due to high vibration on the #1 and #2 bearings. Vibrations continued to rise, following the turbine trip, and at 0414, the reactor was manually tripped from approximately 12% power to permit breaking vacuum in the Main Condenser[COND] and prevent further potential damage to the Main Turbine due to the high vibrations. Event Notification 55910 was submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JG] actuation as a four (4) hour non-emergency report, and under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), specified system actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA], as an eight (8) hour non-emergency report. The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the manual reactor trip.",3152022001R00,3152022001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
,Unknown Unit,Main Steam Safety Valve Setpoints Found Outside Technical Specifications Limits,4/15/2021,"On April 15, 2021, Donald C. Cook Unit 2 was in Mode 1 and holding at approximately 49% reactor power while performing Technical Specification (TS) surveillance testing on the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs) prior to the Unit 2 Cycle 26 (U2C26) Refueling Outage. The Unit 2 Steam Generator (SG) #3 MSSV 2-SV-1A-3 and 2-SV-2B-3 as-found lift setpoint test pressures were above the TS allowable setpoint pressure band of +/- 3 percent. SG #2 MSSV 2-SV-2B-2 as-found lift setpoint was below the allowable setpoint pressure. Setpoint drift was determined as the similar cause for the affected MSSVs.  Following adjustments, the MSSVs met the as-left testing criteria of +/- 1 percent lift setpoint pressure The identified discrepancies would normally be considered to occur at the time of test. However, based on the guidance in NUREG-1022, Revision 3, for ""Multiple Test Failures"", the condition may have arisen over a period of time during the operating cycle. In accordance with NUREG-1022 guidance, MSSVs are considered to have been inoperable during plant operation, for a period longer than allowed by TS.  Therefore, this event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 15, 2021, Donald C. Cook Unit 2 was in Mode 1 and holding at approximately 49% reactor power while performing Technical Specification (TS) surveillance testing on the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs) [SB] [RV], prior to the Unit 2 Cycle 26 (U2C26) Refueling Outage. The as found lift setpoint pressure of the Unit 2 Steam Generator (SG) [SG] #3 MSSV 2-SV-1A-3 was 1099.1 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), which was above the TS allowable lift setpoint pressure band of +/- 3% of 1065 psig. The valve met the seat-leakage requirement. After adjustment, the valve met the as left testing criteria of +/- 1% of the lift setpoint of 1065 psig. The as found lift setpoint pressure of the Unit 2 SG #3 MSSV 2-SV-2B-3 was 1126.8 psig, which was above the TS allowable setpoint pressure band of +/- 3% of 1075 psig. The valve met the seat-leakage requirement. After adjustment, the valve met the as left testing criteria of +/- 1% of the lift setpoint of 1075 psig. The as found lift setpoint pressure of the Unit 2 SG #2 MSSV 2-SV-2B-2 was 1040.0 psig, which was below the TS allowable setpoint pressure band of +/- 3% of 1075 psig. The valve met the seat-leakage requirement. After adjustment, the valve met the as left testing criteria of +/- 1% of the lift setpoint of 1075 psig. Due to the as found lift setpoint pressure of 2-SV-1A-3, 2-SV-2B-3, and 2-SV-2B-2 being outside of acceptance limits, the ASME OM Code requires all 20 SG MSSVs to be tested. All of the remaining valves tested from SG #1, SG #2, SG #3, and SG #4 were within the as found acceptance criteria of +/- 3% of the lift setpoint pressure. TS Limiting Condition For Operation 3.7.1 requires a minimum of 20 MSSVs (5 per SG) to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3. Based on the guidance in NUREG-1022, Revision 3, 2-SV-1A-3, 2-SV-2B-3, and 2-SV-2B-2 were considered to be inoperable longer than allowed by TS, since this condition may have arisen over a period of time and thus, the MSSVs may not have been operable during plant operation. Therefore, this event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications. COMPONENT The MSSVs are Consolidated-Dresser model 3707RA Valves. CAUSE OF THE EVENT A failure mode effects and analysis evaluation was performed for the three valves 2-SV-1A-3, 2-SV-2B-3, and 2- SV-2B-2. This evaluation determined that setpoint drift is responsible for not meeting the surveillance test acceptance criteria. No further corrective action is necessary due to the low frequency of failure of these valves and the historical randomness of setpoint drift.",3162021001R00,3162021001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications
,Unknown Unit,Manual Reactor Trip due to an Unisolable Steam Leak,6/22/2021,"On June 22, 2021, Donald C. Cook Unit 2, was operating at 100 percent power. At approximately 2305 hours, equipment operators reported a steam leak in a crossover pipe at the Right Moisture Separator Reheater (MSR) joint that was unisolable. Operators manually tripped the reactor at 2331 hours.  All safety systems and Engineered Safety Features equipment operated as expected. Prior to the reactor trip, operators closed the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) 'B' Left Reheat Steam Intercept Valve at 1040 hours, due to an electro-hydraulic control (EHC) fluid leak from the valve's hydraulic actuator.  Following closure of the intercept valve, the EHC fluid leak from the hydraulic actuator was manually isolated. No abnormal system conditions were noted following closure of the valve. This valve closure is an abnormal system alignment. A failure investigation determined that the steam leak occurred at a right MSR crossover piping expansion joint. The expansion joint protective liner was displaced downstream due to a failed weld that exposed the bellows to direct steam flow. The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), System Actuation, due to the valid actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Auxiliary Feedwater System, as a result of the manual reactor trip.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On June 22, 2021, Donald C. Cook (CNP) Unit 2, was operating at 100 percent power. At approximately 2305 hours, excessive steam noise was noted on the Unit 2 Turbine Building [NM] 633' elevation. Equipment operators were dispatched to investigate and reported a steam leak in a crossover pipe at 2-OME-80R, Right Moisture Separator Reheater (MSR) [SB][MSR] that was unisolable. Operators manually tripped the reactor [RCT] at 2331 hours. All safety systems and Engineered Safety Features equipment operated as expected. Prior to the reactor trip, operators closed 2-OME-93-BL, Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) 'B' Left Reheat Steam Intercept Valve [S13][V] at 1040 hours, due to an electro-hydraulic control (EHC) fluid leak from the valve's hydraulic actuator. Following closure of the intercept valve, the EHC fluid leak from the hydraulic actuator was manually isolated. No abnormal system conditions were noted following closure of 2-OME-93-BL and isolation of EHC supply to the hydraulic actuator. This valve closure is an abnormal system alignment. Event Notification 55322 was submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JG] actuation as a four (4) hour non-emergency report, and under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), specified system actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA], as an eight (8) hour non-emergency report. A failure investigation was conducted following the reactor trip and determined that the steam leak occurred at 2-XJ-113-5, Right MSR OME-80R Reheat Steam to LPT 'B' Expansion Joint [SB][EXJ]. Upon disassembly, a circumferential weld attaching the liner which protects the convolutions (or bellows) from direct steam flow had failed. The failed weld allowed the liner to displace downstream which exposed the bellows to direct steam flow. The direct exposure of steam flow to the bellows resulted in increased local turbulence and vibration, leading to high cycle fatigue of the bellows, and the eventual steam leak. During the failure investigation and extent of condition evaluation, the design of the expansion joint liner was reviewed. A design change was implemented to increase the thickness of the inner liner from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch. Additionally, a thicker weld was specified to attach the liner to the replacement expansion joint. The LPT 'A' Left, 'B' Right, and 'C' Left expansion joints were replaced that included the liners and welds with the revised specifications. Following completion of repairs, Unit 2 was returned to service when the main generator [TB][GEN] was synchronized to the electrical grid at 2328 hours on July 8, 2021.

Diablo Canyon Power Plant,2,Emergency Diesel Generator Declared Inoperable due to Low Frequency Condition Discovery during Routine Surveillance,7/22/2021,"On July 22, 2021, with Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 2, operating at 100 percent power, DCPP personnel determined that since June 30, 2021, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 2-3 would not have been able to attain Technical Specification (TS) minimum frequency when started in automatic. Manual control of diesel frequency was not affected. This condition was discovered via a routine surveillance test which evaluates, in part, EDG frequency during standby and loading conditions. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation of the plant in a condition prohibited by DCPP TS due to the EDG frequency being outside TS required limits for a period beyond the TS required completion time. This event is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. However, upon discovery, the remaining two of the three EDGs were operable. The condition was corrected and the EDG was restored to Operable status on July 22, 2021. A subsequent evaluation determined that the low frequency condition did not prevent EDG 2-3 from performing its specified safety function.","I.  Reporting Requirements This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) and the associated guidance of NUREG-1022, Revision 3, as an operation or condition prohibited by Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Technical Specifications (TS), due to the emergency diesel generator (EDG) frequency being outside TS required limits for a period beyond the associated TS required completion time. This event is also being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. However, it should be noted that two of the three EDGs were operable at the time of discovery. II. Plant Conditions At the time of the event, DCPP Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power. III. Problem Description A. Background DCPP Units 1 and 2 each have three EDGs. The safety function of the EDGs is to provide AC power to Engineered Safety Features (ESF) loads when offsite power is unavailable. The specified safety functions of EDG 2-3 are: a. to furnish sufficient power to mitigate a design basis accident in one unit and safely bring DCPP to cold shutdown for the other unit when both offsite power sources are unavailable. b. to furnish power sufficient for a controlled shutdown of the plant whenever the main turbine-generator and the offsite power sources are not available. To satisfy these functions, the EDG 2-3 must be capable of automatically starting, accelerating to rated speed and voltage in under 10 seconds and connecting to its respective ESF Bus on detection of Bus undervoltage (UV). B. Event Description On July 22, 2021, with DCPP Unit 2, operating at 100 percent power, DCPP personnel determined that since June 30, 2021, EDG 2-3 would not have been able to attain TS minimum frequency when started in automatic. Manual control of diesel frequency was not affected. On July 21, 2021, EDG 2-3 was started on a simulated UV signal for routine surveillance testing. The EDG was started with the mode select switch in the ""AUTO"" position which indicates the diesel was aligned for dedicated supply to its associated 4 KV vital electrical Bus. The frequency indicated 58.90 Hz and diesel speed indicated 880 revolutions per minute. Per the surveillance testing procedure, the frequency should have been between 59.5 Hz and 60.5 Hz (accounting for instrument uncertainty) on the start prior to any adjustments. EDG 2-3 was placed in manual, the frequency and speed were adjusted into their proper band, and then the surveillance test was completed meeting all acceptance criteria. However, due to the frequency attained following the automatic UV start, EDG 2-3 was declared INOPERABLE.",3232021001R00,3232021001R00,"50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(D)",,
Diablo Canyon Power Plant,2,Unit 2 Reactor Coolant System Pressure Boundary Degradation,10/23/2022,"At 0830 PDT on 10/23/2022, during routine outage inspections on Unit 2, it was determined that the reactor coolant pressure boundary did not meet American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section XI acceptance criteria due to finding a through-wall indication at a 2-inch stainless steel socket weld (Weld No. WIB-975D) on the cold leg Loop 1 vacuum refill connecting piping (Line No. 1140), and was therefore reportable. This event is being reported per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) as a degraded condition. The presumed cause of the degradation was vibration-induced fatigue propagation of a flaw initiated at a weld defect. Corrective actions to address the condition consisted of performing a weld repair in accordance with ASME BPVC Section XI Case N-666-1 during the refueling outage. There was no impact to the health and safety of the public or plant personnel.","I. Reporting Requirements This event is being reported for Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 2 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) and the associated guidance of NUREG-1022, Revision 3, as a degraded condition due to the failure to meet American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section XI acceptance criteria for a 2- inch stainless steel socket weld (Weld No. WIB-975D) on the cold leg Loop 1 vacuum refill connecting piping (Line No. 1140). This event was initially reported in Event Notification 56176 in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii) (A) as a degraded condition. II. Plant Conditions At the time of the event, DCPP Unit 2 was in MODE 6, Refueling during the twenty-third refueling outage for that unit (2R23). III. Problem Description A. Background Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] Line 1140 serves as a normally closed vacuum refill connection point on the RCS Loop 1 cold leg piping downstream of reactor coolant pump (RCP) 2-1.  The subject piping??¢s function is to facilitate the vacuum refill method of filling the RCS when preparing for plant operation at the conclusion of a refueling outage. DCPP Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 5.2.2.1 states, in part, that the reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) is defined as those piping systems and components that contain reactor coolant at design pressure and temperature. RCPB piping systems and components are defined as Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) Quality/ Code Class I, with the exception of those RCPB components excluded from PG&E Quality/Code Class I requirements by 10 CFR 50.55a, as described in UFSAR Section 3.2.2.3. With the exception of the reactor coolant sampling lines, the entire RCPB, as defined above, is located entirely within the containment structure. The RCS boundaries are designed to accommodate the system pressures and temperatures attained under all expected modes of plant operation, including all anticipated transients, and to maintain the stresses within applicable limits. B. Event Description At 0830 PDT on 10/23/2022, during routine outage inspections on Unit 2, it was determined that the RCPB did not meet ASME BPVC Section XI acceptance criteria due to identification (boric acid residue) of a through-wall indication at a 2- inch stainless steel socket weld (Weld No. WIB-975D) on the cold leg Loop 1 vacuum refill connecting piping (Line No. 1140), and was therefore reportable.

Sequoyah Nuclear Plant,1,Reactor Trip on High Neutron Flux Rate Due to Dropped Control Rods,5/24/2021,"On May 24, 2021, at 0915 eastern daylight time (EDT), SQN Unit 1 experienced an automatic reactor trip.  Approximately 0.5 seconds before the reactor trip, an unexpected Rod Control Urgent Failure alarm annunciated and Control Bank B, Group 2 rods began to lower. The reactor trip first out alarm indicated the trip was from a Power Range High Neutron Flux Rate detected by the Power Range Nuclear Instruments. During troubleshooting, it was discovered that there were bad pin connections on the backplane of the phase card associated with Control Bank B (the card connection between the Control Bank B, Group 2 stationary gripper phase control card and the backplane of its card cage). All plant safety systems responded as designed. All rods fully inserted as required. The direct cause of the failure has been attributed to the card connection between Control Bank B Group 2 stationary gripper phase control card and the backplane of the card cage. Periodic instruction procedure, PI-674 Periodic Calibration of the Full Length Rod Control Power, directs activities to remove phase control cards during calibration which can result in pin deformation. Therefore, the corrective action for this event is to revise the procedure to modify how calibration activities are performed based on learnings obtained from the equipment failure evaluation.","Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent rated thermal power (RTP).

Sequoyah Nuclear Plant,1,Exceeded Breach Margin Renders Both Trains of the Auxiliary Building Gas Treatment System Inoperable,8/20/2021,"On August 20, 2021, at 0905 eastern daylight time main control room operators were notified that auxiliary building secondary containment enclosure (ABSCE) boundary Door A118 was open.  This was discovered by Fix-it-now personnel that were in the process of establishing compensatory measures associated with an active breach permit for Door A118.  A past operability evaluation determined that ABSCE Door A118 had been left open without compensatory measures in place on four occasions between August 18 and August 20, 2021.  The open door created a breach of the ABSCE boundary that exceeded the allowed breach margin and rendered both trains of the Auxiliary Building Gas Treatment System (ABGTS) inoperable.  Additionally, the POE determined that due to the unknown inoperability of the ABGTS, the requirements of Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.12 Condition E were not met. The cause of the event was miscommunication between the Work Control Center Senior Reactor Operator and Maintenance Services personnel on the requirements of the ABSCE breaching procedure, related to the work being performed, resulting in a breach permit not being issued when required. Corrective actions included revising the ABSCE breaching procedure to clarify exception requirements and require a breach permit if an ABSCE door will be left open greater than the allowable time and briefings with Operations personnel concerning the requirements of the ABSCE breaching procedure.","I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated thermal power. II. Description of Event A.  Event Summary: On August 20, 2021, at 0905 eastern daylight time (EDT), main control room (MCR) operators were notified that auxiliary building [EIIS: NF] secondary containment enclosure (ABSCE) boundary Door [EIIS: DR] A118 was open. This was discovered by Fix-it-now (FIN) personnel that were in the process of establishing compensatory measures associated with an active breach permit for Door A118. The arrival of FIN personnel, with a breach permit and appropriate compensatory actions to close the door as required, allowed operators to determine the ABSCE was operable at the time of discovery. Investigation revealed Maintenance Services personnel had been taking equipment through the door as part of ongoing work associated with a glycol chiller replacement project. The work order had instructions to obtain an ABSCE breach permit; however, when Maintenance Services personnel reported to the Work Control Center (WCC) to obtain the permit, the WCC senior reactor operator (SRO) incorrectly determined an ABSCE breach permit was not required. As a result, ABSCE Door A118 was left open without a breach permit and required compensatory measures until FIN personnel discovered the issue at 0905. A past operability evaluation (POE) determined that ABSCE Door A118 had been left open without compensatory measures in place on four occasions between August 18 and August 20, 2021 (the longest period the door was open without compensatory measures in place was approximately 21 minutes). The open door created a breach of the ABSCE boundary that exceeded the allowed breach margin. The four occasions should have caused entry into Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.12, Condition B for two trains of the Auxiliary Building Gas Treatment System (ABGTS) [EIIS: VF] inoperable due to an inoperable ABSCE boundary in Mode 1, 2, 3, or 4 and Condition E for a required train of ABGTS inoperable with fuel stored in the spent fuel pool. The inoperability of two trains of the ABGTS during the required mode of applicability constitutes an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (C) control the release of radioactive material and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident.

Sequoyah Nuclear Plant,1,Failure of 1B-B Centrifugal Charging Pump Results in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications,7/22/2022,"At 2230 eastern daylight time (EDT) on July 18, 2022, operators declared the 1B-B Centrifugal Charging Pump (CCP) inoperable and entered Condition A of the Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.2 for one or more trains of the Emergency Core Cooling System inoperable. Enforcement discretion of TS LCO 3.5.2 was requested because the estimated time required to troubleshoot, repair, and test the 1B-B CCP would exceed the 72 hours allowed by Condition A. The request was granted for a period of 69 hours not to exceed a total time of 141 hours. At 1635 EDT on July 24, 2022, the 1B-B CCP was declared OPERABLE. Because the 1B-B CCP was inoperable for approximately 138 hours and the unit was not placed in MODE 3 within 78 hours, this constitutes an operation or condition prohibited by TSs. Disassembly of the 1B-B CCP element showed severe wear on impellers 11 through 6 and less severe wear on impellers 5 through 1. The wear was on one side of the impellers. This is indicative of shaft bowing. Dye penetrant examination of the shaft showed a crack in the split ring keeper key groove at the 11th stage impeller. Pending completion of the destructive analysis, the most likely cause of the failure is low stress, high cycle fatigue. The 1B-B CCP element was replaced. Corrective actions include implementing preventative maintenance tasks to periodically replace CCP shafts.  There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event as the 1A-A CCP was started and available until the 1B-B CCP was OPERABLE.","I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated thermal power. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary: At 2130 eastern daylight time (EDT), on July 18, 2022, operators in the main control room (MCR) noticed that the pressurizer [EIIS: PZR] level was slowly lowering with the downstream flow control valve near 100 percent open with the 1B-B Centrifugal Charging Pump (CCP) [EIIS: CB] [EIIS: P] in service. Thereafter, operators received an unexpected alarm for low flow to the reactor coolant pump (RCP) 1 [EIIS: AB] seal. Seal injection flow was adjusted and the low flow alarm for RCP 1 cleared. Operators dispatched auxiliary unit operators (AUOs) to the field to validate MCR indications. Subsequently, operators received an alarm indicating a lowering pressurizer level with level indicating 54 percent and slowly lowering. Operators placed the 1A-A CCP in service and pressurizer level began to recover. At 2230 EDT, on July 18, 2022, operators declared the 1B-B CCP inoperable and entered Condition A of the Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.2 for one or more trains of the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) inoperable. TS LCO 3.5.2 Condition A has a 72-hour Completion Time (CT) to restore a train(s) to OPERABLE status. If the train is not restored to OPERABLE within 72 hours, the unit is required to be in MODE 3 within 6 hours and MODE 4 within 12 hours. Enforcement discretion of TS LCO 3.5.2 was requested because the estimated time required to troubleshoot, repair, and test the 1B-B CCP would exceed the 72 hours allowed by Condition A. The request was granted for a period of 69 hours not to exceed a total time of 141 hours. At 1635 EDT on July 24, 2022, the 1B-B CCP was declared OPERABLE. Because the 1B-B CCP was inoperable for approximately 138 hours and the unit was not placed in MODE 3 within 78 hours, this constitutes an operation or condition prohibited by TSs and is therefore being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).

Abstract  (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time, during power descension for the upcoming Unit 1 refueling outage, main control room operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam Throttle Valve 2 (TV-2), associated with the high-pressure turbine and turbine trip function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as to why the valve failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure analysis, the most likely cause of valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve components. The valve and the associated actuator were replaced to correct the condition. Once the failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective action program to address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.

Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately 24 percent rated thermal power preparing for a refueling outage. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary: On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time (EDT), during power descension for the upcoming refueling outage, main control room (MCR) operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam [EIIS: SB] Throttle Valve-2 (TV-2) [EIIS: FCV], associated with the high-pressure turbine [EIIS: TRB] and turbine trip [EIIS: JJ] function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. After the turbine trip was initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested, the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) closed as expected with no challenges. This demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV operability was challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2. TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during the refueling outage. A past operability evaluation (POE) determined TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. The POE determined the turbine trip function requires four out of four throttle valves to close, and with TV-2 inoperable, the turbine trip function would not have been performed within the required 2.5 seconds (per the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR)). Therefore, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 (Verify ESFAS [Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System] RESPONSE TIMES are within limit) would not have been met. This constitutes an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident, which is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).

Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error: Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as to why the valve failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure analysis, the most likely cause of valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve components. B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: There were no human performance related causes. IV.  Analysis of the Event: The primary functions of the Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation signals are to prevent damage to the turbine due to water in the steam lines, and to stop the excessive flow of feedwater into the steam generators (SGs). These Functions are necessary to mitigate the effects of a high-water level in the SGs, which could result in carryover of water into the steam lines and excessive cooldown of the primary system. Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation functions must be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3 except when all main feedwater (MFW) isolation valves (MFIVs), MFW regulation valves (MFRVs), and associated MFRV bypass valves are closed or isolated by a closed manual valve when the MFW System is in operation and the turbine generator may be in operation. Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation is also initiated by all Functions that initiate a Safety Injection (SI) signal. Turbine trip is a required part of ESFAS as outlined in TS 3.3.2. The response time testing requirement for turbine trip is 2.5 seconds per the FSAR. TS 3.3.2 requires that the throttle valves close in 1.1 seconds (SR 3.3.2.9) so that, when combined with the other trip logic in a turbine trip signal, the overall response time testing requirement is met. The turbine trip function requires four- out-of-four throttle valves to close. During the period of inoperability, the main turbine governor valves were closed and thus also functioning to remove steam flow from the main turbine. These valves function as a series valve to the throttle valves and receive the same trip signal that is supplied to the throttle valves. These valves are not response time tested, but at the time of this event, were all functioning correctly which includes tripping closed in a similar time to the throttle valves??design time. Additionally, there was no challenge with the Feedwater Isolation function or MSIVs. With the MSIVs available, the capability existed to mitigate a cooldown event by isolating all steam supplied from the reactor to the secondary plant.

Assessment of Safety Consequences There were no actual safety consequences because of this event. After the turbine trip was initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested, the MSIVs closed with no challenges. This demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV operability was challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2. A probabilistic risk assessment determined that increase to risk for Core Damage Frequency or Large Early Release Frequency was considered negligible. A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that failed during the event: With TV-2 inoperable, there were additional methods to stop steam flow to the main turbine, closure of the main turbine governor valves, and another, closure of the MSIVs. B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident: The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down. C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. VI.  Corrective Actions The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP) under Condition Report 1811241. A. Immediate Corrective Actions: TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during refueling outage. B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring in the future: The valve and the associated actuator were replaced to correct the condition. Once the failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective action program to address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.

Sequoyah Nuclear Plant,2,Ice Bed Inoperable Due to Exceeding Surveillance Requirement Frequency,7/25/2021,"On July 25, 2021, at 0544 eastern daylight time (EDT), the SQN Unit 2 ice bed temperature monitoring system stopped providing accurate data for the ice bed. The data is used to complete a surveillance instruction (SI) to verify the ice bed temperature does not exceed 27 degrees Fahrenheit (F) as required by Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.12.1 at a Frequency of every 12 hours. Due to the failure, Main Control Room operators authorized performance of 2-SI-IXX-061-138.0, Backup Ice Condenser Temperature Monitoring.

Therefore, the Unit 2 ice bed was declared inoperable for 20 minutes from 1238 until 1258. The cause of the event was the failure of the ice bed temperature monitoring system remote scanner due to an internal power supply failure. Corrective actions for this event include developing procedural guidance for the response required for a nonfunctional ice bed temperature monitoring system and replacement of obsolete instrumentation in the ice bed temperature monitoring system.","I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated thermal power. II. Description of Event A.  Event Summary: On July 25, 2021, at 0544 eastern daylight time (EDT), the SQN Unit 2 ice bed [EIIS: BC] temperature monitoring system stopped providing accurate data for the ice bed due to the failure of a remote scanner [EIIS: MPX] in the system. The data is used to complete a surveillance instruction (SI) to verify the ice bed temperature does not exceed 27 degrees Fahrenheit (F) as required by Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.12.1 at a Frequency of every 12 hours. Due to the failure, Main Control Room (MCR) operators authorized performance of 2-SI-IXX-061-138.0, Backup Ice Condenser Temperature Monitoring, which requires calling in instrumentation and controls technicians to take resistance temperature detector readings on individual temperature elements inside containment. At 1258, SR 3.6.12.1 was successfully performed; however, the completion time exceeded the specified Frequency plus the 25 percent extension allowed by SR 3.0.2 by 20 minutes (SR 3.6.12.1 had last been completed at 2138 on July 24). SR 3.0.1 states, in part, ??f]ailure to perform a Surveillance within the specified Frequency shall be failure to meet the LCO [limiting condition for operation].??Therefore, the Unit 2 ice bed was declared inoperable for 20 minutes from 1238 until 1258. At 1600, an 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 55379) was made to the NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v), as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (C) control the release of radioactive material and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident. This LER is submitted based on NUREG-1022, Revision 3, Section 3.2.7 guidance that identifies that the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) apply when a system that is within the scope of the criterion is declared inoperable and no redundant system or equipment could be declared operable (the ice bed is a single train system). Although the Frequency of SR 3.6.12.1 was exceeded and required the Unit 2 ice bed to be declared inoperable, the Unit 2 ice bed remained below 27 degrees F and capable of performing its required safety function to provide a heat sink during a Design Basis Accident (DBA) in containment. Therefore, no loss of safety function occurred.",3282021001R00,3282021001R00,"50.73.(a)(2)(v)(C), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(D)",,
Sequoyah Nuclear Plant,2,Turbine Trip Function Inoperable Due to Slow to Close Turbine Throttle Valve,11/8/2021,"On October 28, 2021, Main Steam Throttle Valve 1 (TV-1), associated with the high-pressure turbine and turbine trip function, was replaced during the Unit 2 refueling outage. On November 5, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 was successfully completed for the Turbine Trip function. On November 8, at 2115 eastern standard time (EST), during turbine overspeed trip testing, it was identified that TV-1 took longer than expected to close on the overspeed trip signal. In response, station personnel developed a support/refute matrix that included validating installation of an orifice block vice a flushing block in TV-1. This led to the discovery that TV-1 was installed with the incorrect block. The flushing block was replaced with the correct orifice block. On November 9, at 0700, SR 3.3.2.9 was successfully completed restoring the valve to operable status. The cause of the event was the failure to follow procedural requirements regarding a quality critical maintenance (QCM) step. The maintenance procedure addressing quality critical maintenance requires that supervision/oversight must be present in the field during the execution of steps requiring additional oversight. Contrary to this requirement, The TVA QCM signee performed the step in an independent verification role vice providing oversight and witnessing the installation of the correct orifice plate. Corrective actions included providing a briefing for Outage Services personnel regarding oversight responsibilities associated with QCM steps and revising the vendor's procedure ""Critical Step"" with photos and guidance to visually confirm and photograph blocks when installing.","I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at approximately 15 percent rated thermal power. II. Description of Event A.  Event Summary: On October 28, 2021, Main Steam [EIIS: SB] Throttle Valve-1 (TV-1) [EIIS: SCV], associated with the high-pressure turbine [EIIS: TRB] and turbine trip [EMS: JJ] function, was replaced during the Unit 2 refueling outage. On November 5, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 (Verify ESFAS [Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System] RESPONSE TIMES are within limit) was successfully completed for the Turbine Trip function. On November 8, at 2115 eastern standard time (EST), during turbine overspeed trip testing, it was identified that TV-1 took longer than expected to close on the overspeed trip signal. During subsequent testing, TV-1 continued to close slower than expected. In response, station personnel developed a support/refute matrix that included validating installation of an orifice block vice a flushing block in TV-1. This led to the discovery that TV-1 was installed with the incorrect block. The flushing block was replaced with the correct orifice block. On November 9, at 0700, SR 3.3.2.9 was successfully completed restoring the valve to operable status. At 0745 a partial performance of turbine overspeed testing confirmed TV-1 was functioning as required. During the Unit 2 refueling outage, TV-1 was one of several turbine control system valves replaced. Valves received from the vendor typically arrive with flushing blocks installed and are clearly labeled as such. Two of the replacement valves were received with labeled flushing blocks attached. TV-1 was received from the vendor without a labeled flushing block that appeared to be and was assumed to be the required orifice block for the valve. Total reliance was placed on the vendor method for labeling flushing blocks. The delta in closing times between the November 5th ESFAS testing and the November 8th turbine overspeed testing is most probably the result of different system alignments during the tests. During the performance of ESFAS testing, the four main steam throttle valves are manipulated with the governor valves remaining closed and isolated from the Electrohydraulic Control (EHC) System. Whereas, during the performance of turbine overspeed trip testing, all the throttle valves and governor valves are manipulated. It is possible that additional flow in the EHC trip header, due to flow from the additional valves, could cause increased backpressure on the throttle drain to the trip header. With the flushing block installed on TV-1 rather than the required orifice, it is possible the backpressure on TV-1 could reduce the effectiveness of draining EH fluid to the trip header. This reduced flow would in turn slow the response of TV-1 to close. A condition report (CR) was initiated to evaluate if the system",3282021002R00,3282021002R00,"50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(D)",,

Personnel from both groups failed to recognize that the acceptance criteria associated with four ice condenser intermediate deck doors were not met. At 2035 eastern daylight time, the unit entered a Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.13 applicable mode, Mode 4, with four inoperable intermediate deck doors. Because SQN Unit 2 entered an applicable mode without meeting TS LCO 3.6.13, this is a condition prohibited by TS and is therefore being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plantÃ‚?™s Technical Specifications. The cause of the event was an error trap in the SI procedure, in that, the acceptance criteria in the SI procedure were not distinct for the particular door being tested to alert the performer and the reviewer of the acceptable values. The corrective action was to revise the SI procedure to remove the error trap by listing the specific acceptance criteria to each door being surveilled.","I. Plant Operating Conditions before the Event At the time of discovery, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 2 was in Mode 3. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary: On April 11, 2023, with Unit 2 in Mode 5, a surveillance instruction (SI) associated with Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.13, Ice Condenser Doors, was completed by Maintenance Services personnel and provided to Operations personnel for review. Personnel from both groups failed to recognize that the acceptance criteria associated with four ice condenser [EIIS: BC] intermediate deck doors [EIIS: DR] (the ice condenser has 24 bays, and each bay has 8 intermediate deck doors) were not met (Door 2 in ice condenser bays 13, 15, 16, and 17). On April 14, 2023, at 1130 eastern daylight time (EDT), with the unit in Mode 4, main control room (MCR) operators were made aware that the acceptance criteria associated with the four intermediate deck doors were not met. Upon notification, MCR operators entered SQN Unit 2 into TS 3.6.13, Ice Condenser Doors, Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO), Condition B and completed Required Action B.1 that verifies the maximum ice bed temperature is less than or equal to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (F). Additionally, MCR operators authorized a conditional performance of the SI to verify the lifting force of the four intermediate deck doors was acceptable. At 1446, the acceptance criteria were determined to be met and TS LCO 3.6.13 Condition B was exited. Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.13.6 requires verification that each intermediate deck door is free of movement. According to the SR 3.6.13.6 Bases, the intermediate deck door lifting force for Door 2 should be less than or equal to 33.8 pounds. The SR is applicable in Modes 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Beaver Valley Power Station,1,Containment Isolation Valve Found Restrained Open Resulting in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications,5/8/2021,"On May 8, 2021, during startup from the 27th Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit 1 (BVPS-1) refueling outage, BVPS-1 entered Mode 4 and then Mode 3 without satisfying Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.3, Containment Isolation Valves, Limiting Conditions for Operation as required by LCO 3.0.1 and LCO 3.0.4. TS 3.6.3 LCO requires containment isolation valves be operable in Modes 1, 2, 3 and 4. TS LCO 3.0.1 requires that LCOs be met during Modes or other specified conditions in the Applicability. TS LCO 3.0.4 requires that with an LCO not met, entry into a Mode of applicability shall only be made when the associated actions to be entered permit continued operation in the Mode for an unlimited period of time or when a risk assessment has been performed determining that entry into the Mode is acceptable. Contrary to LCO 3.0.4, while in Mode 3, it was discovered that containment isolation check valve 1QS-4 (quench spray pump discharge check valve) was inoperable. The check valve was inadvertently left open during performance of a loop seal fill procedure while in Mode 5. The root cause was determined to be a loss of configuration control of 1QS-4 due to human performance errors by the Operations supervisor. The corrective action is to revise the loop fill procedure to direct that the check valves are added to the containment penetration log when being restrained open.

Beaver Valley Power Station,1,Manual Reactor Trip and Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation due to Heater Drain System Valve Failure,6/15/2022,"At 0724 on June 15, 2022 while at approximately 100 percent power, the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 1 (BVPS-1) reactor was manually tripped due to lowering steam generator water levels. This was due to reduced heater drain flow from the heater drain system (HDS) to the main feedwater pumps (MFPs) when the heater drain receiver normal level control valve, LCV-1SD-106B, experienced a valve plug to stem separation. The Operators manually tripped the reactor as required per the predefined trip criteria for low steam generator water level. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1), and the automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6). Corrective actions include replacing the plug, stem, and pin (trim) of LCV-1SD-106B with an enhanced design during the next refueling outage (Fall 2022).","Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND The Unit 1 Heater Drains System (HDS) [SN] is designed to collect drains from the feedwater heaters, main turbine reheater steam coils, and moisture separators and deliver the condensate to the Main Feedwater Pumps (MFPs) [SJ] as steam generator feedwater. Either of two full size heater drain pumps take suction from the heater drain receiver and discharge into the MFP suction header. The MFPs deliver the feedwater to the steam generators. Normal level is maintained in the heater drain receiver by modulation of the level control valve, LCV-1SD-106B [LCV], at the discharge of the heater drain pumps. HDS flow rates are based upon supplying sufficient heater drain flow, together with the condensate system [SG], to satisfy the operational requirements of the steam generator MFPs. The HDS is designed to supply 25 percent of full feed flow required for operation of the steam generator MFPs. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT At 0100 on June 13, 2022 while at full power operation, heater drain pump flow oscillations were identified with indications that LCV-1SD-106B was binding. An action plan was developed if the LCV were to fail and operators were briefed for a potential controlled down power. At 0724 on June 15, 2022 while at approximately 100 percent power, the BVPS-1 reactor was manually tripped due to lowering steam generator water levels. This was due to reduced condensate flow from the HDS to the MFPs when LCV-1SD-106B experienced a valve plug to stem separation. The trip was not complicated and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3. All control rods [AA] fully inserted into the reactor core. The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) [BA] automatically actuated on low steam generator water level as expected, and the AFW system performed as designed.

The direct cause of the event was High Cycle Fatigue Piping Failure of the ""A"" High Pressure Heater Drain Receiver High Level Divert Line that caused damage to condenser tubes and degraded condenser vacuum. Unit 2 continued to operate at 100% power, Mode 1, during the event. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.","1.0 Description of Event On May 6, 2021 at 0900 hours with Unit 1 and Unit 2 in Mode 1, 100% power, North Anna Unit 1 exceeded the Action Level 3 for Secondary Chemistry as identified in O-CH-99.600 (Secondary Chemistry Specifications and Action Levels) and began an orderly shutdown using 1-OP-2.2 (Unit Power Operations from Mode 1 to Mode 2). During the ramp, procedure 1-MOP-48.30 (Main Condenser ??""A"" Waterbox) was in progress to isolate the ""A"" Condenser Waterbox (EIIS Component COND, System SG) due to suspected tube leakage. When the waterbox was isolated, a degradation of condenser vacuum was identified on May 6, 2021 at 1219, and the control room team entered 1-AP-14 (Low Condenser Vacuum). On May 6, 2021 at 1223, while in 1-AP-14 at 60% reactor power, the crew initiated a manual reactor trip based on previous briefings and contingencies established when the decision was made to isolate the ""A"" Condenser Waterbox. At 1400 hours on May 6, 2021, a 4-hour and 8-hour non-emergency report was made per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) for RPS Actuation (scram) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for a valid actuation of an ESF system, respectively. A broken pipe cap in the ""A"" Condenser from the ""A"" High Pressure Heater Drain Tank High Level Divert Line (EIIS Component PSP, System SN) was identified. This pipe cap damaged tubing in the ""G"" section of the tube bundle in the ""A"" Condenser Waterbox. This tube damage allowed air ingress when the ""A"" Condenser Waterbox was isolated, which caused the degrading vacuum. Following the Unit 1 trip, the Unit 1 ""A"", ""B"", and ""C"" MSR Flow Control Valves (EIIS Component FCV, System SN), 1-MS- FCV-104A/B/C, indicated mid position with the associated control switch in the CLOSED position, with controller demand at 0%. The limit switches were adjusted/repaired without issues. Additionally, one of the two Intermediate Range Nuclear Instruments (NI), N-36 (EIIS Component DET, System IG), was found to be under compensated during the reactor shutdown. 2.0 Significant Safety Consequences and Implications No significant safety consequences resulted from this event. Unit 1 was promptly removed from service and all Engineered Safety Feature equipment responded as designed. The affected pipe cap was repaired, and damaged condenser tubes were plugged. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event. 3.0 Cause of the Event The direct cause of the event was High Cycle Fatigue Piping Failure of 1-SD-TK-1A, ""A"" High Pressure Heater Drain Receiver High Level Divert Line (EIIS Component PSP, System SN), that caused damage to condenser tubes and degraded condenser vacuum. Contributing to this failure was high level divert line design and piping orientation and craftsmanship on the flat pipe cap end plate weld. Additionally, there was insufficient procedural guidance on performing detailed inspections on the High Pressure Heater Drain Receiver High Level Divert Lines. 4.0 Immediate Corrective Action The immediate corrective action included inspecting and repairing the failed ""A"" High Pressure Heater Drain Receiver High Level Divert Line. Additionally, the Unit 1 Main Condenser tubes affected by the High Level Divert Line failure in the ""A"" Condenser Waterbox were inspected and repaired.

The leak was discovered while Unit 2 was shut down for a refueling outage. The leak was not quantifiable based on the small amount of boric acid noted and, therefore, well within the capability of one charging pump (EIIS Component P, System CB). The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event. 3.0 Cause of the Event The direct cause of the weld failure was due to inadequate welding process control by the welder. The specific socket welds in question exhibited poor workmanship by having a large degree of melt-through and suck-back on the inside surface, and multiple arc strikes and excessive grinding on the outside surface. During the metallurgical failure analysis, the sample was sectioned through the area of suspected leakage, which revealed a lack of fusion defect between the weldment and base metal. The degree of lack of fusion confirmed in the laboratory analysis was substantial enough to provide the eventual leak path after a 25-year service period. 4.0 Immediate Corrective Action Both the leaking socket welded coupling and a non-leaking downstream socket welded coupling were replaced. NDE surface examinations were performed on the replacement socket welds, and the area was also examined during an external leakage check. 5.0 Additional Corrective Actions Additional Liquid Penetrant (LP) exams were performed on tubing welds from the pressurizer steam space to a different Pressurizer level transmitter. No weld flaws or boric acid residue was identified during these examinations.

Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant,1,Automatic Reactor Trip due to Turbine Generator Trip,4/22/2021,"At 1450 CDT on April 22. 2021, with Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 48% power an automatic reactor trip occurred due to a main turbine trip. The main turbine / generator trip was due to data input error in the exciter switchgear software during exciter testing. The trip was not complex with all systems responding normally. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Due to low decay heat load, the Main Steam Isolation valves were closed to minimize cooldown and the Atmospheric Relief Valves were used to remove decay heat. This event was initially reported as event notification 55206. Corrective Actions included correcting the data entry in the exciter switchgear control software and performing causal analysis on the human performance aspect of this event. This event is reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of a system listed in 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv) (B). FNP Unit 2 was not affected during this event.","A. EVENT I CAUSE DESCRIPTION: At 1450 CDT on April 22, 2021. with Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 48% power an automatic reactor trip [EEIS: JC] occurred due to a main turbine [EEIS: TA] trip. Unit 1 had just recently completed a refueling outage and was ascending in power. The unit was at 48% power with exciter switchgear LEEIS:TLI power ascension testing in progress by ABB contractors under the supervision of FNP Site Projects personnel. The ABB contractor updating the software made a human performance error and inserted an incorrect setpoint value within the exciter switchgear software. This caused the exciter to drive the excitation voltage and current on the generator to near zero. This caused a corresponding rise in generator current on all three phases. Ultimately, this sequence was secured when the distance relay [EEIS: TB / 21] provided a generator trip. This resulted in a cascading turbine trip and subsequent automatic reactor trip. B. SAFETY ASSESSMENT REPORTABILITY: There were no safety consequences as result of this event. The operating crew responded correctly to the event. The applicable abnormal / emergency operating procedures were properly entered and documentation met expectations. This event was within the analysis of the UFSAR Chapter 15. Additionally, no radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) as identified in 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). C. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: Corrective Actions included correcting the data entry in the exciter switchgear control software and performing causal analysis on the human performance aspect of this event. Causal analysis determined there was a lack of risk recognition and over reliance on vendor expertise. D.

Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant,1,Outdated Relay Settings Resulted in an Automatic Reactor Trip After a Floor Tile was Dropped in High Voltage Switch House,8/3/2022,"At 1258 CDT on August 3, 2022, with Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the reactor automatically tripped following a generator trip and subsequent turbine trip signal. A floor tile was dropped in the high voltage switch house resulting in a relay actuation that electrically isolated Bus 1 in the 230kV switchyard. The ""B"" train emergency safeguards (ES) bus lost power along with 1B, 1C, and 1E non safety related 4160V busses. The 1A 4160V non safety bus did not fast bus transfer to its alternate power supply, which along with isolation of the 230kV Bus 1, resulted in all Reactor Coolant Pumps being deenergized. Residual heat was removed by natural circulation via the atmospheric relief valves. The 1B emergency diesel automatically actuated due to the loss of power to the 'B"" train ES bus. In addition, the Auxilliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically started as expected in response to the reactor trip. Corrective actions include calibrating the associated relays following revision to calculations and relay sheets. Additionally, the design calculation change process will be revised to ensure plant impacts are incorporated into plant procedures. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of multiple systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). FNP Unit 2 was not affected during this event.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On August 3, 2022, at 1258 CDT, while Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, a transmission worker moving floor tiles in the high voltage switch house dropped a floor tile creating vibration near a relay panel [EEIS: FK] which actuated relay TD-50 [EEIS: FK / 62]. Relay TD-50 is designed to isolate bus 1 of the 230kV switchyard upon a fault. For Unit 1 this protection scheme resulted in the loss of the ""B"" Train Emergency Safeguards (ES) bus [EEIS: EB] and Non Safety 4160V Busses 18 / 1C / 1E. Relays KD-10 (Distance Relay) [EEIS: FK/21] and KC-2 (Current Relay) [EEIS: FK / 67] are in series to protect the main generator from overcurrent. KD-10 actuated per design when the 230kv bus 1 lost voltage. KC-2 is designed to actuate on high current through the generator output breakers. It was determined post trip that KC-2 was set improperly. It was determined that while online at 100% power, KC-2 was in an actuated state because the actual current was above its setpoint. Thus, when KD-10 actuated the circuit was completed to send a trip signal to the main generator. The generator trip and subsequent turbine trip [EEIS:J WEL] resulted in an automatic reactor trip [EEIS:AA/JC]. The 1B emergency diesel [EEIS: EK] automatically started upon the loss of power to the ""B"" train ES bus. Subsequent to the automatic actuation of the reactor protection system (RPS), the auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pumps [EEIS: BA] automatically started as expected. The 1A 4160V non safety bus did not fast bus transfer to its alternate power supply, which along with isolation of the 230kV Bus 1, resulted in all Reactor Coolant Pumps [EEIS: AB] being deenergized. Unit 1 residual heat was removed via natural circulation via the atmospheric relief valves immediately following the event. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event was a combination of a human performance event and a legacy relay setting error. The relay actuations from the dropped floor tile, by itself, would not have resulted in a reactor trip. The KD-10 relay was actuated upon the loss of the 230kV Bus 1, however had KC-2 been set properly, the generator trip and subsequent reactor trip would not have occurred. The relay values of KC-2 had not been updated following a design calculation change, and the design calculation change process did not identify when an update to associated relay settings sheets were required. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences as result of this event. The operating crew responded appropriately to the event. This event was within the analysis of the UFSAR Chapter 15. Additionally, no radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the RPS, the 1B Emergency Diesel, and the AFW system as identified in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED 1.R evise Design Calculation and update relay setpoint sheets. 2. Calibrate KC-2 relay to new setpoints. 3. Revise the governing procedures for the design calculation change process. 4. Incorporated improved work control zones and labeling in the switchyard relay house.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) At 0956 CST on February 1, 2023, with Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the reactor automatically tripped following a turbine trip signal. The turbine tripped when Maintenance personnel connected portable DC ground detection equipment (DC Scout) to the positive terminal of the ""B"" train Auxiliary Building battery to locate a DC ground. Connecting the DC Scout created a jumper to the normally open contact of the Turbine Trip Solenoid. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3 and removed decay heat via steaming to condenser. Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically actuated as expected in response to the reactor trip. Corrective actions include changes to risk mitigation procedures associated with detecting DC grounds and use of portable ground detection equipment. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and AFW system as listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B).

D 2023 052 001 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On February 1, 2023, at 0956 CST, while Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, maintenance was conducting troubleshooting to identify the source of an Auxilliary Building (AB) ""B"" Train DC ground. The ground was identified to be on the negative side of the AB Battery [EIIS / EEIS : EJ / BTRY]. When portable ground detection equipment (DC Scout) was connected to the positive terminal of the AB Battery a loss of Electro Hydraulic Control (EHC) [EIIS: TG] oil pressure occurred which resulted in a turbine trip and subsequent reactor trip. During the forced outage it was determined that the DC ground existed on a cable between the AB and Turbine Building associated with the Turbine Trip Solenoid Valve (20-ET) [EIIS / EEIS: TG / SOL]. The 20-ET solenoid valve is normally closed and energizes to open to dump EHC oil from the turbine throttle valves and governor valves. It was confirmed via troubleshooting that when maintenance connected the DC Scout to the AB Battery terminal it created a jumper in the circuit to energize the 20-ET solenoid. During the plant trip the ""1A"" 4 kV non emergency bus [EIIS : EA] failed to transfer to the ""1A"" 4 kV Startup Transformer [EIIS : EB]. This resulted in the trip of the ""A"" Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) [EIIS / EEIS: AB / P]. The ""B"" and ""C"" RCPs remained in operation. Additionally, Auxilliary Feedwater System (AFW) [EIIS: BA] autostarted as expected post reactor trip and maintained feedwater flow to the Steam Generators (EIIS: SB). Main Feed Water (MAW) [EIIS: SJ] and the condenser [EIIS: SG] remained available for post trip decay heat removal. EVENT ANALYSIS It was determined that previous unrelated work at penetration 07-155-31 had resulted in damage to cable 1UYT0001E [EEIS : CBL4] which feeds the 20-ET solenoid. This damage inside the penetration breach was not visible and had resulted in the AB DC ground alarm. The risk of actuating equipment in the circuit while installing portable ground detection equipment was not known and led to missed opportunities in work planning and risk mitigation. The failure of the bus transfer to occur was determined to be a failure of the Time Delay Drop Out (TDDO) relay [EEIS / EIIS: El / 62] (Manufacturer: General Electric / Model: 12HGA17C52) associated with the 4 kV bus transfer circuit. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences as result of this event. The operating crew responded appropriately to the event. This event was within the analysis of the UFSAR Chapter 15. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the AFW system as identified in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED 1. Repaired grounded cable 1UYT0001E to 20-ET Turbine Trip Solenoid. 2. Revise maintenance and risk procedures for mitigation actions during ground detection activities and while using portable ground detection equipment. 3. Replaced the TDDO relay associated with the 1A 4 kv bus. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS There were no events from the last three years with either the same or similar cause to this event.

Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant,1,Residual Heat Removal Pump Inoperable for Longer than Allowed by Technical Specifications,10/2/2023,"At approximately 10:00 CDT on October 2, 2023, with Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the 1B residual heat removal (RHR) pump failed to start on demand during the quarterly surveillance run and was subsequently declared inoperable. The immediate investigation determined that the 1B RHR pump circiut breaker racking release handle had been placed in the ""Trip Free"" position instead of ""Operational"". The same 1B RHR pump surveillance run was last completed satisfactorily on July 5, 2023, and there was no work on the 1B RHR pump between July 5th and October 2nd that would have required manipulation of the component's breaker. The most likely cause was an inadvertent misposition of the wrong breaker during the 1B Emergency Diesel (EDG) surveillance the morning of August 28, 2023. Corrective actions included placing the circuit breaker racking release handle in the ""Operational"" position and addressing human performance issues with the performance management process. The surveillance was completed satisfactorily and the 1B RHR pump returned to operable status. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) for the 1 B RHR pump being inoperable for longer than allowed by Technical Specification 3.5.2.

Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the 1B residual heat removal (RHR) pump [EllS: BP] failed to start on demand during the quarterly surveillance run and was subsequently declared inoperable. The immediate investigation determined that the 1B RHR pump circuit breaker [EIIS/EEIS: BP/52] racking release handle had been placed in the ""Trip Free"" position instead of the ""Operational"" position. Within an hour of the failure to start, the circuit breaker racking release handle was placed in the ""Operational"" position allowing the charging springs to charge. The 1B RHR pump quarterly surveillance run was completed satisfactorily at approximately 13:30 and the pump returned to operable status. This same surveillance on the 1B RHR pump was last run on July 5, 2023 and completed satisfactorily. There was no work on the 1B RHR pump between July 5th and October 2nd that would have required manipulation of the component's breaker. EVENT ANALYSIS An investigation of this incident determined that the most likely cause of the 1B RHR circuit breaker racking release handle being in the ""Trip Free"" position was due to human performance errors which resulted in the inadvertent mispositioning of the wrong breaker (1B RHR pump breaker) during the 1B Emergency Diesel (EDG) [EIIS: EK] surveillance the morning of August 28, 2023. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT Based on the most probable cause of the 1B RHR pump inoperability, there were no safety consequences since the 1A RHR pump was available from August 28th until October 2nd to perform the system's safety function.

Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant,1,Unit 1 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) lube oil pump outlet coupling leak,2/26/2023,"On February 26, 2023 at 23:42, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the 1B Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) circulating lube oil pump outlet coupling connection developed an oil leak resulting in the inoperability of the 1B EDG. The cause of the leak was inadequate restraints on the piping, which allowed movement of the piping and resulted in a failure of the lube oil pressure boundary by the piping separating from the coupling. An additional cause was determined to be inadequate troubleshooting from a similar issue which occurred on November 4, 2022. To correct the issue, the existing lube oil pipe restraint for the 1B EDG was modified, and a new additional restraint was installed. The condition was later eliminated with the implementation of rigid piping. The troubleshooting process deficiencies and implementation weaknesses were corrected by revisions to the procedures that clearly define roles, responsibilities and required documentation for issue response, troubleshooting and corrective actions addressing deficient conditions. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) due to the 1B EDG being inoperable, which failed to meet the LCO in accordance with TS 3.0.1 and 3.8.1 between December 7, 2022, and March 3, 2023.","EVENT DESCRIPTION On February 26, 2023 at 23:42, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the 1B Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) [EllS Code: DG] circulating lube oil pump outlet coupling connection [EIIS Code: LL, CPLG] developed an oil leak when the 2 inch lube oil piping became separated at the Flexmaster coupling location resulting in the inoperability of the 1B EDG. The cause of the leak was inadequate restraints on the piping, which allowed movement of the piping and resulted in a failure of the lube oil pressure boundary by the piping separating from the coupling. EVENT ANALYSIS The root cause analysis determined that the 1B EDG lube oil leak was caused by inadequate restraints on piping adjacent to the circulating lube oil pump outlet Flexmaster coupling connection. The lack of adequate restraints allowed movement of the adjacent piping which resulted in a failure of the lube oil pressure boundary by the piping separating from the coupling. The 1B EDG Circulating Lube Oil Pump Discharge piping moved because the designed piping restraint was inadequate to prevent movement. An additional cause was determined to be troubleshooting process deficiencies and implementation weaknesses that led to not identifying and correcting the 1B EDG circulating lube oil system failure mode in November 2022. The February event was the second failure involving the 1B EDG coupling connection. The original leak occurred on November 4, 2022, following the replacement of a flexible coupling on the 1B EDG as part of a new preventive maintenance (PM) activity during an equipment outage. During the return to service maintenance run, the circulating lube oil pump discharge coupling separated from the oil piping causing in an oil leak. The station leaders' oversight of the lube oil leak evaluation and resolution activities was less than adequate to identify and correct the coupling assembly failure. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT As a result of the inadequate trouble shooting of the November 4, 2022 1B EDG lube oil leak and coupling assembly separation, the 1B EDG was vulnerable to initiating events which could adversely affect the ability to supply emergency power. From December 7, 2022 to March 3, 2023 while the plant was in the modes of Applicability, the 1B EDG was inoperable. Based on the availability of redundant onsite power, no loss of safety function occurred during the inoperability of the 1B EDG. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) due to the 1B EDG being inoperable, which failed to meet the LCO in accordance with TS 3.0.1 and 3.8.1 between December 7, 2022, and March 3, 2023. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED The following corrective actions were taken 1. In February 2023, the existing lube oil pipe restraint for the 1B EDG was modified, and a new additional restraint was installed. The condition was eliminated in October 2023 with the implementation of rigid piping. 2. Troubleshooting process deficiencies and implementation weaknesses were corrected by revisions to the procedures that clearly define roles, responsibilities and required documentation for issue response, troubleshooting and corrective actions addressing deficient conditions.

Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant,2,Pressurizer Code Safety Valve Lift Pressure Outside of Technical Specifications Limits,8/1/2023,"On June 14, 2023, Farley Unit 2 entered Mode 5 to conduct planned maintenance on the 2A Pressurizer Code Safety Valve (PSV) which had indications of leaking. The PSV was removed from the system and delivered to a vendor to test in accordance with Technical Specification (T/S) 3.4.10, Pressurizer Safety Valves. On August 1, 2023, while in Mode 1 at 100% power level, Farley Unit 2 was informed by the vendor that the set pressure results were outside of the T/S as-found acceptance criteria of 2423 - 2510 psig. During as-found testing the 2A PSV failed to lift. Additional testing by the vendor using in-situ device identified that 2A PSV lifted at approximately 2599 psig. Although this value is greater than T/S limits, the 110% ASME Code limitation and Safety Limit were not exceeded. The failure to lift within the acceptable band was determined to be the result of internal steam cutting of the disc insert and nozzle. The 2A PSV was replaced during the planned outage with a pre-tested spare.","EVENT DESCRIPTION: On July 8, 2022, it was identified that the 2A Pressurizer Code Safety Valve (PSV) [EEIS:AB/RV] began leaking as evidence by elevated tailpipe temperatures and Pressurizer Relief Tank (PRT) parameters. The 2A PSV (Serial # N56963-01-0001, Manufacturer: Crosby, Model: HB-86-BP) was installed on Unit 2 during refuel 27 (2R27) in the fall of 2020. The 2A PSV was monitored throughout the cycle, and a maintenance outage was planned based on the expectation that pre-identified operational triggers would be met. On June 14, 2023, Farley Unit 2 entered Mode 5 to conduct planned maintenance on the 2A PSV. Following the shutdown, the 2A PSV was removed from the system on June 16, 2023, and delivered to a vendor to test in accordance with Technical Specification (T/S) 3.4.10. The 2A PSV was replaced with a pre-tested spare. Unit 2 completed the planned outage and reached Mode 1 on June 19, 2023. On August 1, 2023, while in Mode 1 at 100% power level, Farley was informed by the vendor that the set pressure results were outside of the T/S as-found acceptance criteria of 2423 - 2510 psig. During as-found testing at the vendor facility the 2A PSV failed to lift. Additional testing by the vendor using an in-situ device identified that 2A PSV lifted at approximately 2599 psig which is a 4.6% error of set pressure (2485 psig). EVENT ANALYSIS: Leakage past the seat was also identified during testing at the off-site facility. The cause of the 2A PSV failure to lift was determined to be the result of excessive steam cutting of the valve disc insert and nozzle. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT: Although the T/S pressure limit was surpassed, the ASME Code limitation and Safety Limit of 110% design pressure was not exceeded. This failure constitutes a condition that is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), ""Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications."" Although seat leakage was evident while online beginning in July of 2022 there is no firm evidence of when the failure to meet the lift setting requirements occurred prior to the time of discovery at the test facility. There were no actual safety consequences for this event. No safety system responses occurred. There was no release of radioactivity. During operation, all three PSVs are required to be operable per T/S 3.4.10. The combined relief capacity of all three valves is greater than the maximum surge rate resulting from a complete loss of steam flow to the turbine assuming no reactor trip until the first Reactor Trip System trip set point is reached (i.e., no credit is taken for a direct reactor trip on the loss of load) and assuming no operation of the pressurizer power-operated relief valves (PORV5) or steam dump valves. Each PSV is designed to relieve 345,000 lbs per hour of saturated steam at the valve setpoint. The Reactor Coolant System (RCS) is protected from overpressure regardless of a reactor trip, assuming all PSVs function properly. Should the reactor trip at the first protection grade trip (High Pressurizer Pressure), then only 40% of the total valve capacity is required. This 40% readily falls within that provided by the other two PSVs and protection from over pressurization can be expected. With the two other operable PSVs this issue had very low safety significance. Additionally, this issue did not prevent the PSVs from fulfilling their design safety function and the existing configuration risk monitor, Phoenix Risk Model (PRM), showed little to no increase in risk due to the PSV being out of service.",3642023001R00,3642023001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications
Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant,2,Main Steam Safety Valve Lift Pressure Outside of Technical Specifications Limits due to Setpoint Drift,10/3/2023,"On October 3, 2023, while in Mode 1 at 92% power level, it was discovered that a Unit 2 Main Steam Safety Valve (MSSV) failed its as-found lift pressure test. The MSSV lifted above the Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.1 allowable lift setting value. Setpoint drift is the most likely cause of the MSSV setpoint failure. It is likely that the MSSV was outside of the TS limits longer than the allowable completion times for the associated Required Action Statements during the operating cycle in all applicable modes of operation. Therefore, this condition is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS. The MSSV setpoint was adjusted to within the TS limits and returned to service restoring compliance. The MSSV that failed the surveillance setpoint test was replaced with a refurbished valve during the 2R29 refueling outage and sent to vendor for analysis.","EVENT DESCRIPTION: On October 3, 2023, at 1650 CDT, while operating in Mode 1 and at 92% power level, a B Loop Main Steam Safety Valve (MSSV), Q2N11V0011C [EIIS:SB:RV] as-found lift pressure did not meet the acceptance criteria of +/- 3% of setpoint (1102 psig) as required by Technical Specifications (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.1.1. The MSSV lifted high at 1140 psig which is 5 psig outside of its acceptance range of 1069 to 1135 psig. The +/- 3% as-found lift pressure requirement is an ASME Section III, 1971 edition, and Farley TS requirement to ensure that the MSSV provides adequate protection by preventing the steam pressure from exceeding 110% of the main steam system design pressure. EVENT ANALYSIS: The MSSV (Manufacturer: Dresser, Model Number: 3707R, Serial Number: BP-09820) was sent to NWS Technologies for failure analysis due to the failed as-found test. Setpoint drift is the most likely cause of the MSSV setpoint failure. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY EVALUATION: This failure constitutes a condition that is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), ""Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications."" The applicable accident/transient analyses requires five MSSVs per Steam Generator [EIIS:SB:SG] to provide overpressure protection for design basis transients occurring at 102% Rated Thermal Power. On October 3, 2023, MSSV Q2N11V0011C was found outside of its required setpoint range and was declared inoperable. As it is not possible to determine when the valve exceeded the allowable setpoint range, the MSSV was likely inoperable for greater than the TS allowed completion time. Based on the MSSV as-found lift setpoint being less than 110% of design Steam Generator pressure (1194 psig), and properly reseating, this one MSSV failure did not result in a loss of safety function. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: MSSV Q2N11V0011C was adjusted within TS tolerance and returned to operable status. Additonally, an expanded scope inspection of MSSVs Q2N11V0011E and Q2N11V0011D was completed satisfactory. The MSSV (SN BP-09820) was subsequently removed from its location during the 2R29 refueling outage for analysis and was replaced on October 17, 2023, with a refurbished valve that was heat soaked and placed in the Q2N11V0011C location at the required 1102 psig +/-1%. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS: A similar event was reported in 2017 (LER 2017-002-00) and in 2020 (LER 2020-001-01).

Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant,2,Pressurizer Code Safety Valve Lift Pressure Outside of Technical Specifications Limits,10/24/2023,"On October 24, 2023, while at 0% power level and Mode 6 (refueling), it was discovered that a Unit 2 pressurizer code safety valve (PSV), which had been removed during the refueling outage (2R29) and shipped off-site for testing, failed its as-found lift pressure test. The PSV lifted above the Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10 allowable lift setting value. Setpoint drift of the PSV is the most likely cause of the failure. It is likely that the PSV was outside of the TS limits longer than allowable by the Required Action Statement (15 minutes) during the previous operating cycle in all applicable modes of operation. Therefore, this condition is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS. The PSV was replaced during the October 2023 refueling outage.","EVENT DESCRIPTION: On October 24, 2023, while Unit 2 was at 0% power level and in Mode 6 (Refueling), with the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] at atmospheric pressure and 91 degrees Fahrenheit, the 2C Pressurizer Code Safety Valve (PSV) [RV] (Serial # N56963-01-0003, Manufacturer: Crosby; Model: HB-86-BP) was removed as part of the routine In-Service Testing (1ST) program and sent to an off-site testing facility. The as-found lift pressure was discovered to be 2522 psig which was outside of the Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10 allowable lift pressure settings of >/= 2423 psig and <1= 2510 psig. The tested valve was within the ASME code acceptance band of +/- 3% (2411-2559 psig). Based on the lift pressure meeting the 1ST program (ASME code) monitored requirements, there was no 1ST scope expansion for the PSV. EVENT ANALYSIS: Setpoint drift of the PSV was determined to be the most likely cause of the failure. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT: This failure constitutes a condition that is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), ""Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications."" There is no firm evidence, prior to the time of discovery at the test facility, of when the failure occurred. Since the as-found lift setpoint was within ASME Code allowance and less than 110% design pressure of the RCS, the condition did not have an adverse impact on its over-pressurization function. The as-found lift pressure was 2522 psig, and the valve re-closed following the lift. There were no actual safety consequences for this event. No safety system responses occurred. There was no release of radioactivity. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: The PSV was replaced during the October 2023 refueling outage. The as-left setpoints were within +1- 1% tolerance. Previous corrective actions for PSV failures included a spring changeout campaign for all PSV's and TS 3.4.10 was also previously revised. The 2C PSV that was removed was the last PSV in the spring changeout campaign. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS: Similar events have been reported for Unit 1 and Unit 2.

Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant,2,Manual Reactor Trip due to Rising Steam Generator Levels,11/14/2023,"On November 14, 2023, Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 2 was performing an initial reactor startup following Refueling Outage 29 (2R29). With reactor power at approximately 10%, steam generator (SG) levels began to rise while in automatic control. Operators took manual control of the main feedwater regulating and main feedwater regulating bypass valves but were unable to control the rise in SG levels. At 1041 CST the operators initiated a manual reactor trip prior to reaching high SG level setpoint. All equipment responded as expected. NRC was notified in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for a specified system actuation via ENS 56852. The cause of the event was determined to be Ovation steam and feedwater flow signal errors resulting in the automatic feedwater controls transferring to 'high power mode' at a lower reactor power level than designed (10% versus 20%). This resulted in rising SG Levels and led the operators to manually trip the reactor. Following correction of Ovation signal errors post trip, operators were able to complete the reactor startup and reached full power on November 19, 2023.","INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: On November 14, 2023, while in Mode 1 and 10% reactor power, Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 2 was returning to power following Refueling Outage 29 (2R29). During 2R29, the feedwater control system [EEIS:JB] was upgraded. The newly upgraded system is a digital-based Emerson Ovation System. This system operates in two modes: low-power and high-power. The transition between the two modes is automatic and based on the measured loop feedwater flow exceeding a predefined threshold. Both control modes operate the main feed regulating valves (MFRVs) and the MFRV bypass valves [EEIS: SJ-FCV], as appropriate. No systems, structures, or components (SSCs) were inoperable that contributed to the event. EVENT DESCRIPTION: At 1041 CST on November 14, 2023, FNP Unit 2 reactor was manually tripped due to rising Steam Generator (SG) [EEIS: SB / SG] water levels. Prior to the reactor trip, control room personnel had raised power from approximately 3% to 7% power and had entered Mode 1. Operators stabilized power at 7% to troubleshoot an issue related to the newly-installed modification. Operators had established a control limit of 20% power while troubleshooting continued and began a power ascension to 12%. Although SG level control was initially stable in automatic, operators observed that SG levels began to rapidly rise at 10% reactor power. As SG levels increased, operators took manual control of the MFRVs and MFRV bypass valves to stabilize levels. However, during the transient the SG levels rose above a predetermined manual reactor trip criteria based on SG level. Operators tripped the reactor prior to reaching any automatic reactor trip setpoint. At the current power level and Reactor Coolant System temperature an automatic feedwater isolation occurred per design. During restoration after the trip, the operators restored feedwater capability by manually initiating Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW). BASIS FOR REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT: There were no safety consequences as result of this event. The operating crew responded appropriately to the event. This event was within the analysis of the UFSAR Chapter 15. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and AFW system as listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). FNP Unit 1 was not affected during this event. CAUSE: The cause of the event was determined to be the Ovation steam and feedwater flow signal errors resulted in automatic feedwater controls to transfer to 'high power mode' at low reactor power. This resulted in SG levels rising forcing the operators to initiate a manual reactor trip. It was determined that during the design change, process errors were introduced which were not identified during testing. Steam flow and feed flow inputs to the Ovation system were higher than actual control board indications. The Ovation system performs an automatic swap to high-power control at 20% feedwater flow. With the higher Ovation feedwater flow signals, the swap to high-power flow control occured at approximately 10% reactor power. It was identified that there was a flow correction duplication in Ovation. This flow correction was already present in the Control System. A contributor to this event was inadequate communication surrounding the signal errors between plant departments and the Outage Control Center due to the lack of adequate team structure.",3642024001R00,3642024001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
McGuire Nuclear Station,Unknown Unit,Automatic Actuation of the 1A Motor Driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Due to Human Error,10/18/2023,"On October 18, 2023, an actuation of the A Train Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) pump occurred while Unit 1 was in Mode 5 during a planned refueling outage. Maintenance technicians were performing PT/0/A/4600/012 A (Train A Reactor Trip Breakers Actuating Device Operational Test for Manual Trip Function) and removed the incorrect fuse in the 1A Solid State Protection System (SSPS) cabinet, temporarily deenergizing Train A SSPS Slave Relays. This caused the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit to reset, and in turn, start the 1A AFW pump. The Automatic Recirculation Valve (ARV) provided the required flow path for pump protection. Auxiliary Feedwater was not supplied to the respective Steam Generators due to the motor operated discharge isolation valves (MOVs) being closed as required for current plant conditions. At the time of the 1A AFW actuation, the Main Feedwater (MFW) pumps were in a tripped condition, and decay heat removal was being provided by the 1A Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System. Both MFW pumps being in tripped status provided the logic for the AFW actuation signal once the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit was reset. Corrective actions included personnel accountability and reinforcement of human performance tools.","BACKGROUND This event is being reported under the following criterion: 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), ""Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B).??The Emergency Feedwater System is specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)(6).

McGuire Nuclear Station,2,Valid Actuations of the Unit 2 B Train Emergency AC Power System and B Train Auxiliary Feedwater System,9/13/2021,"On 9-13-21, at approximately 0011 hours, Unit 2 was in Mode 5 (Cold Shutdown), when valid actuations of the 2B Emergency AC Electrical Power System and 2B Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System occurred during Engineering Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) testing. During restoration from a portion of the test, the 2B Diesel Generator (DG) Load Sequencer blackout (BO) logic inadvertently actuated while resetting the 2B DG Load Sequencer. At the time, the 2B DG was operating in standby and the 2ETB Essential 4160 Volt Switchgear was energized by offsite power. The inadvertent BO circuitry actuation de- energized 2ETB which sealed in the load sequencer BO logic. 2ETB was load shed, the 2B DG breaker closed, and the BO loads, including the 2B Motor Driven AFW Pump, were loaded in their proper sequence. Offsite power was restored to 2ETB and the 2B DG and 2B Motor Driven AFW Pump were secured per procedure. The DG Load Sequencer BO logic was inadvertently actuated prior to the blocking circuit preventing actuation due to a latent design error which introduced a design margin vulnerability within the load sequencer BO circuitry. This vulnerability is also applicable to the 1A, 1B, and 2A DG Load Sequencers. Engineering Changes (ECs) which eliminate the design margin vulnerability were implemented on the 2A and 2B DG Load Sequencers and are planned to be implemented on the 1A and 1B DG Load Sequencers. Also, a compensatory action was implemented on Unit 1 which mitigates the design margin vulnerability until the ECs are implemented. There was no impact on the health and safety of the public or plant personnel.","BACKGROUND The following system and component information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER. Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets. McGuire Nuclear Station unique system and component identifiers are contained within parentheses. Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System, Diesel Generator Load Sequencer [JE] (EQB) The engineered safety features actuation system includes the instrumentation and control components, modules, and other equipment that operates to maintain plant parameters within acceptable limits during a design basis event. Typically, the engineered safety features actuation system initiates emergency negative radioactivity insertion, post-accident heat removal, emergency core cooling, post-accident radioactivity removal, and containment isolation. The Diesel Generator Load Sequencer System functions to energize the necessary blackout (BO) and/or safety injection (SI) loads in a prescribed sequence and in such a manner so as not to momentarily overload the diesel generator or auxiliary transformer. The Diesel Generator (DG) Load Sequencer has three modes of operation: SI concurrent with a BO, SI only, and BO only. During SI concurrent with a BO and SI only, the DG Load Sequencer BO logic should remain blocked to prevent inadvertent actuation. Diesel Generator Control System [EK] (EQC) The Diesel Generator Control System consists of the electrical controls and instrumentation necessary for starting and operating each of the four emergency diesel generators at McGuire Nuclear Station. The DGs provide power to the train specific 4160 Volt bus in the event of a loss of power to the bus. Also, during a SI actuation, the DGs are operated in standby in case a BO occurs. The 4160 Volt bus provides power to equipment essential for safe shutdown of the plant during a design basis event. McGuire has two emergency DGs per unit. Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA] (CA): The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically supplies feedwater to the steam generators (S/Gs) to remove decay heat from the Reactor Coolant System upon the loss of normal feedwater supply.

"McGuire Nuclear Station,-",2,Valid Actuation of the Unit 2 Reactor Protection System and Auxiliary Feedwater System,2/18/2022,"On 2/18/2022, at 0449 hours, McGuire Nuclear Station Unit 2 Digital Electro-Hydraulic Control System (DEH) experienced a component failure causing a spurious rapid turbine load rejection and un-demanded closure of Throttle Valves (TV) #2 and #4. During the event, the DEH system reverted to manual control, reactor power decreased, and plant systems responded as expected. Due to plant stability concerns, the reactor was manually tripped at 0459. Following the reactor trip, steam generator (SG) levels decreased to the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) autostart setpoint and all AFW pumps started as expected and began providing feedwater to the SGs. This additional SG input lowered reactor coolant average temperature and resulted in a Feedwater Isolation as designed. The reactor trip was uncomplicated with all systems responding normally post-trip. Subsequent analyses determined that an electrical disturbance, originating from within the DEH control system cabinet caused DEH to react in an unexpected manner and produce un-demanded turbine valve movement. A contributing factor is that some DEH circuit cards had embedded batteries operating past their expected service life. These cards did not retain control logic and did not reconfigure as expected when reenergized. Corrective actions included hardening the DEH system by performing power-to-ground audits and replacing failed controller modules, cabinet power supplies, and a subset of circuit cards with embedded batteries. A DEH replacement project is currently in the design phase scheduled for implementation in Fall 2024 (Unit 2) and Spring 2025 (Unit 1).","BACKGROUND The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER. Applicable Energy Industry Identification [El IS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets. Reactor Protection System [JC]: The Reactor Protection System (RPS) keeps the Reactor operating within a safe operating range by automatically shutting down the Reactor whenever the limits of the operating range are approached by monitoring process variables. Whenever a direct or calculated process variable exceeds a setpoint the Reactor is automatically tripped to protect against fuel cladding damage or loss of RCS integrity. Station operators may elect to manually actuate the reactor trip switchgear (manual reactor trip) using either of two control board switches. Engineering Safety Feature Actuation System [JE]: The Engineering Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) initiates necessary safety systems, based on the values of selected unit parameters, to protect against violating core design limits and the RCS pressure boundary, and to mitigate accidents. Feedwater System [SJ]: The Feedwater System takes treated Condensate System water, heats it further to improve the plant's thermal cycle efficiency, and delivers it at the required flow rate, pressure, and temperature to the steam generators (SGs). The Feedwater System is designed to maintain proper vessel water levels with respect to reactor power output and turbine steam requirements. An Automatic Feedwater Isolation (FWI) signal will occur if any of the following conditions occur: (1) Safety Injection actuation, (2) Hi Hi SG level (83% Narrow Range on 2/3 channels on 1/4 SGs), and (3) Reactor trip with low Tave (P-4 and < 553 degrees Fahrenheit (F) on 2/4 loops). Digital Electro-Hydraulic Control System [JJ]: The purpose of the Digital Electro-Hydraulic (DEH) Control System is to control the speed and load of the turbine generator by positioning the throttle and governor valves to control steam flow to the turbine.

McGuire Nuclear Station,2,Manual Actuation of the Unit 2 Motor Driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps,4/2/2023,"On April 2, 2023, at 0341, Operations entered the Senior Reactor Operator Decision Making Process after receiving a report that called into question the functionality of the operating 2B Main Feedwater (MFW) Pump Recirculation Valve, 2CF-81. At the time, Unit 2 was in Mode 3, the 2B MFW pump was feeding the steam generators, and the 2A MFW Pump Recirculation Valve 2CF-76 was nonfunctional. At 0352 hours, Operations manually started the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Motor Driven Pumps to feed the steam generators to allow corrective maintenance on the MFW System. The AFW Motor Driven Pumps started as designed. Flow to the steam generators was not adversely impacted during this sequence. Subsequent investigation determined that the 2A and 2B MFW recirculation piping experienced abnormal vibration when flow was introduced through valves 2CF-76 and 2CF-81, making the valves susceptible to failure. The recirculation piping had recently been modified to replace the carbon steel elbow piping immediately downstream of the valves with a stainless steel target tee configuration. To mitigate the issue, the target tee was replaced with the original carbon steel elbow arrangement. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public.","BACKGROUND The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER.

,Unknown Unit,Inadequate 10 CFR 50.59 Results in Failure to Obtain Prior NRC Approval for Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications,5/3/2023,"On May 3, 2023, while starting up from a refueling outage, an NRC inspector questioned compliance for Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 1 being in Mode 5 with 53 of 54 Reactor Vessel head closure bolts fully tensioned, which NRC determined was not in compliance with Technical Specification (TS) Table 1.1-1. Following review of this issue within WBN and NRC management, WBN Unit 1 was returned to Mode 6 on May 4, 2023 at 0237 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). Investigation shows the WBN Unit 1 had operated with only 53 reactor vessel head closure bolts fully tensioned for Cycles 17 and 18 due to a damaged reactor head closure stud hole, which represents a condition prohibited by TS. This event was the result of an inadequate 10 CFR 50.59 screening associated with the temporary modification for allowing WBN to operate with one reactor vessel closure stud out of service. The conclusion of this 50.59 screening determined, incorrectly, that the proposed activity did not require a TS amendment and prior NRC approval. Immediate corrective actions included the submittal and the receipt of a TS amendment allowing operation of WBN Unit 1 with 53 reactor head closure bolts for one cycle. A permanent license amendment request was submitted to the NRC and training will be provided to 50.59 qualified individuals and operations personnel at WBN on this event.","I.

Watts Bar Nuclear Plant,2,Automatic Reactor Trip on Main Turbine Trip caused by Main Feed Pump Trip due to Low Condenser Vacuum,3/17/2021,"On March 17, 2021, at 1004 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 experienced an automatic reactor trip on a main turbine trip due to a main feed pump trip on low condenser vacuum. Concurrent with the reactor trip, the Auxiliary Feedwater system actuated as designed. All control and shutdown rods inserted properly and all safety systems responded as designed. The direct cause of the event was failure of a close latch to maintain an Alternate Supply Breaker open after installation in the Unit 2C Board. The Alternate Supply Breaker closed causing the Normal Supply Breaker to open, de-energizing the Unit 2C Board. The 2C Condenser Circulating Water (CCW) Pump lost power causing a reduction of CCW flow and subsequent main feed pump trip on low condenser vacuum. Corrective actions include incorporating vendor enhancements to the breaker maintenance procedures. This condition is being reported as a safety system actuation in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).","I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 was at 90 percent Rated Thermal Power (RTP). Unit 1 was unaffected by this event. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary On March 17, 2021, during the performance of a breaker swap Work Order, the Alternate Supply Breaker [EIIS:BKR] on the Unit 2C Board [EIIS:EA] inadvertently closed and tripped open upon installation. The Normal Supply Breaker opened as designed when the Alternate Supply Breaker closed. This caused a loss of power to the non-safety related Unit 2C Board and subsequent de-energization of the 2C Condenser Circulating Water (CCW) pump [EIIS:P] and reduction of CCW flow to the plant. The lower CCW flow caused condenser vacuum [EIIS:SH] to lower and resulted in a reactor trip on a main turbine trip due to Main Feed Pump (MFP) trip on low condenser vacuum. Concurrent with the reactor trip, all control and shutdown rods fully inserted, the Auxiliary Feedwater (AWF) System [EIIS:BA] actuated as designed, and all safety systems responded as designed. There were no complications associated with the reactor trip. This event is being reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a safety system actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the AFW system. B.

,Unknown Unit,Unanalyzed Condition Related to Loss of the 2A Emergency Diesel Generator During a Postulated Appendix R Fire,5/25/2023,"On May 25, 2023 at 1345 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), operations personnel were verbally notified that a fire barrier for area 737-A1B was not installed, and would render the 2A Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) not operable in the event of a fire on the Unit 2 side of elevation 737 in the Auxiliary Building. The 2A EDG is the credited power source for fire safe shutdown for a fire located in this area. Without the credited source of power, this placed Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 in an unanalyzed condition. A fire watch was established in the area until the issue was resolved. The cause is a legacy design issue which failed to recognize the Normal and Alternate Feeders share the same breaker on the associated 480V shutdown board (2-BD-212-A1-A and 2-BD-212-A2-A). Permanent corrective action by implementation of a design change was completed on June 10, 2023.The design change disconnected the Alternate Feeder Cable for the Diesel Auxiliary Boards from the associated 480V Shutdown Board. Therefore, a fire in fire area 737-A1B would no longer trip the common breaker and the 2A EDG would remain operable.","I.

All control and shutdown bank rods inserted properly in response to the reactor trip. All safety systems, including the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System, performed as designed and there were no complications with the trip. The most likely cause for the main turbine trip was a loose terminal connection for current input into a main transformer phase differential trip relay.

,Unknown Unit,Automatic Reactor Trip Due to Loss of Main Feedwater Regulating Valve Control,8/4/2023,"On August 4, 2023 at approximately 1746 Eastern Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), while operating at 100 percent rated thermal power, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 experienced an automatic reactor trip in response to controls failure of the main feedwater regulating valve to steam generator 2. All control and shutdown bank rods inserted properly in response to the reactor trip. All safety systems, including the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System, performed as designed and there were no complications with the trip. The root cause of the event was determined to be a vulnerability in the design of the Steam Generator (SG) level Distributed Control System (DCS) that prevented automatic and manual control of SG Feedwater (FW) inlet flow. The investigation, at the time of this report, between Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Framatome, and Schneider Electric has not determined the specific reason for the fault seen at WBN. WBN will be implementing a SG level control strategy that prevents the total loss of SG inlet flow control. This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as an automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW).","I. Plant Operating Conditions before the Event Watts Bar Unit 2 was at 100 percent Rated Thermal Power (RTP). II. Description of Event A. Event Summary On August 4, 2023 at approximately 1746 Eastern Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), while operating at 100 percent rated thermal power, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 experienced an automatic reactor trip in response to a loss of feedwater regulating valve [EIIS:FCV] control and a subsequent low steam generator (SG)[EIIS:SG] No. 2 level signal. All control and shutdown bank rods inserted properly in response to the reactor trip. All safety systems, including the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[EIIS:BA] System, performed as designed and there were no complications with the trip. After evaluation of all the field test data and associated field inspections, it was determined that the cause was identified as a failure of Distributed Controls System (DCS)[EIIS:JB] field bus module (FBM). This failure caused the main feedwater regulating valve to oscillate open and close resulting in a reactor trip followed by a turbine trip. The master FBM was removed and the demand signal stabilized when the system swapped to the tracker FBM. The master and tracker FBM were replaced and sent to the vendor for failure analysis.

,Unknown Unit,Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications,6/28/2021,"In 2010, Nuclear Logistics (NLI) was contracted by V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) to replace its 3 safety-related chillers. On June 28, 2021, V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) was notified that the bolted diagonal supports for the NLI safety related chillers (XHX0001A/16/1C) have a bolt (the pin) which would not withstand the combined design seismic and thermal loads. The vendor conclusion was confirmed by VCSNS personnel. As a result, the previous NLI chiller support frame design does not meet required seismic qualification under VCSNS procurement specification for compliance with 10 CFR 50 Appendix A, Criterion 2. At the time of discovery, only the 'A' Chiller had been replaced. Additional support bracing was designed, fabricated, and installed for the affected in-service 'A' Chiller. The enhanced bracing installation has corrected the issue and restored compliance with Technical Specifications (TS). There were no seismic events of consequence to the 'A' Chiller functionality during the time of the deficient seismic restraint (August 5, 2011 until June 29, 2021). However, there were times when the 'A' Chiller was credited as a TS support component, resulting in the plant operating in a condition prohibited by TS.","1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT In 2010, NLI (now a part of Paragon Energy Solutions) was contracted by V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) to provide 3 replacement safety-related chillers. On June 28, 2021, Paragon Energy Solutions notified V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) that the bolted diagonal supports for the NLI safety-related chillers (XHX0001A/1B/1C) have a bolt (the pin) which cannot withstand the combined seismic and thermal loads. The deficiency was confirmed by VCSNS personnel, following review of the vendor documentation. As a result, the NLI chiller support frame design did not meet required seismic qualification under VCSNS procurement specification for compliance with 10 CFR 50 Appendix A, Criterion 2. At the time of discovery, only the 'A' Chiller had been replaced. The 'B' Chiller was in the process of being replaced. The 'C' Chiller (design unaffected by the defective seismic restraint) was operable, with its replacement being fabricated by the vendor. This condition had existed for the 'A' Chiller since its seismic restraint was installed August 5, 2011. The 'A' Train of Chilled Water was declared non-functional at 1435 hrs on June 28, 2021 and the station entered Technical Specification (TS) Action Statement 3.5.2.a. Additional support bracing was designed, fabricated, and installed for the affected in-service 'A' Chiller. The action statement was exited within the allowable 72-hour outage time on June 29, 2021 at 1030 hrs. The enhanced design was applied to the 'B' Chiller, prior to its return to service, and will be applied to the replacement 'C' Chiller at the vendor facility prior to its delivery and installation. The enhanced bracing installation has corrected the issue and brought the issue in line with VCSNS seismic design specifications. There were no seismic events of consequence to the 'A' Chiller functionality during the time of the deficient seismic restraint. 2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS Although not specifically addressed in TS, Safety Related Chilled Water is required for operability of TS-required equipment. The 'A' Chiller seismic restraint was installed August 5, 2011 and subsequently credited as a TS support component. A past functionality evaluation performed on the 'A' Chiller determined the 'A' Chiller was non-functional, as a result of inadequate seismic restraints, from August 5, 2011 to June 29, 2021. During this period, there were occasions when 'A' Chiller was one of two chillers credited for support of the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) equipment, required per TS 3.5.2. The most-limiting ECCS component supported by the Safety Related Chilled Water are the charging pumps. The non-functional 'A' Chiller could have also impacted availability of the Control Room Emergency Filtration System (CREFS) (TS 3.7.6) and potentially other safety-related equipment for some scenarios. These past condition(s) prohibited by TS were not known until Paragon submitted the Part 21 information on June 28, 2021. There were no seismic events of consequence to the 'A' Chiller functionality during the time of the deficient seismic restraint (August 5, 2011 until June 29, 2021). The Chilled Water System provides cooling to safety-related areas (TS Table 3.7-7) as an attendant cooling system and supports the comfort requirements for the Control Room Emergency Filtration Systems (CREFS).

The 'B' EDG satisfied STP-125.002B acceptance criteria; however, since the kilowatt oscillations were not immediately explainable and based on engineering qualitative review for prompt operability, the 'B' EDG was declared inoperable. The unexpected condition of the 'B' EDG resulted in inoperability of the 'B' EDG, contrary to VCSNS Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) 3.8.1.1.b, from January 16 to February 9, 2022.","1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT On February 9, 2022, VCSNS identified kilowatt oscillations in the load of the 'B' Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) during the performance of surveillance test procedure STP-125.002B. The 'B' EDG satisfied STP-125.002B acceptance criteria. Since the kilowatt oscillations were not immediately explainable, the 'B' EDG was declared inoperable. This prompt operability review was based on qualitative engineering analysis. During troubleshooting on February 9, an intermittently connecting pin was discovered in a governor Amphenol connector, which was causing the kilowatt oscillations. The Amphenol connector was replaced to correct the connection issue. VCSNS TS 3.8.1.1.b requires two separate and independent EDGs and appurtenances during Mode 1 through 4 operations. The broken Amphenol connector pin on the 'B' EDG governor wire resulted in inoperability of the 'B' EDG, contrary to VCSNS TS 3.8.1.1.b, from January 16 to February 9, 2022. 2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS The 'B' EDG is one of two safety-related (SR) power supplies on-site and provides the emergency on-site power supply to Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) loads on bus 1DB, in the event of off-site power interruption. Bus 1DB powers one of the two sets of redundant ESF equipment needed in the postulated design basis accident (DBA) scenario. In the event neither EDG is available to power its respective loads, a non-safety related alternate AC power (AAC) source can provide power. The AAC is designed to provide back-up power to either ESF bus whenever one of the EDGs is out of service, particularly in Modes 1 through 4 operation. The design of the AAC is capable of providing the required safety and non- safety related loads in the event of a total loss of offsite power and if both EDGs fail to start and load. Although the AAC is not designed for DBA loads, it is capable of supplying sufficient power to mitigate the effects of an accident. The AAC is not credited in the safety analysis.",3952022002R01,3952022002R01,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e.. approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) MANUAL REACTOR TRIP On April 5, 2023, at approximately 0651 EDT with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 85 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to the loss of Main Feedwater Pump 'C' (FWP 'C') with FWP 'B' removed from service as a part of normal plant shutdown procedures. The turbine tripped automatically based on the reactor trip signal. Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuation occurred as expected due to the low-low steam generator water levels which occurred as a result of the reactor trip.

FWP 'B' was removed from service at 0551 per the plant operating procedures. V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) operations had completed a power reduction to 85% per procedure at 0537 hours and generator output was 865 Mwe. The plant was stable at 85% power to meet the required conditions to support pre-outage scheduled Main Steam Safety Valve testing. These were pre-planned plant operations prior to entering Refueling Outage 27 (RF27). The turbine tripped automatically based on the reactor trip signal. Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuation occurred as expected due to the low-low steam generator water levels which occurred as a result of the reactor trip. The reactor trip was not complex with safety systems responding normally post trip. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Decay heat was removed by the steam generators, utilizing the steam dump system. Subsequently on April 5, 2023, the decision to enter RF27 ahead of schedule was made. With FWP B' removed from service in preparation for a planned shutdown for RF27, the station was aware of the conditional risk of two feedwater pump operation, which was necessary prior to the outage. Aware of the risk, the operating crew was trained and briefed to trip the unit upon loss of one of two operating feedwater pumps in that plant condition. The crew responded accordingly and placed the plant in a safe condition, as previously had been briefed for the condition. Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of the EFW system, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). 2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS The operating crew responded correctly to the event. The applicable emergency operating procedures were properly entered. and documentation met expectations. 3.0 CAUSE OF THE EVENT The apparent cause of the FWP 'C' trip was a combination of the following factors: improper instrumentation thresholds during the last vendor preventative maintenance evolution in 2014, normal thrust bearing wear, and change in pump performance characteristics when the 'B' Main Feedwater Pump was secured. Engineering analysis determined that the thrust bearing wear detector 'Y' clearance was set low at some time in the past, most likely during major inspection as a part of RF21 in the Spring of 2014. The FWP  thrust bearing wear detector configuration on April 5, 2023, did not allow online monitoring of thrust bearing wear oil sensing lines. 4.0 IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS VCSNS entered its planned RF27 and performed a failure modes analysis to determine the FWP 'C' trip cause.

Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant,1,Pressurizer Safety Valve Lift Setpoint Drifted Outside of Technical Specification Tolerance,4/29/2021,"On April 29, 2021, while Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was in Mode 6 for a refueling outage, surveillance testing identified that the lift setting of pressurizer safety valve (PSV) 1RC-123 was -1.3 percent (%) from its setpoint, which is outside the Technical Specification (TS) allowed tolerance of +/-1%. The cause of the PSV lift setting being out of tolerance is a personnel error that resulted in inadvertent installation of a valve that had previously demonstrated setpoint drift incompatible with TS criteria. The PSV was replaced with another PSV confirmed to have a lift setting within the TS allowed tolerance and no history of significant drift. The PSV with a history of significant setpoint drift will be retired from service. The +/-1% TS tolerance is more restrictive than the American Society of Mechanical Engineers code allowed tolerance of +/-3%. In addition, the safety analysis for the PSVs assumes a PSV tolerance of +/- 3%, so the as-found PSV lift setting of -1.3% is well within the safety analysis. Therefore, this event had no significance with respect to the health and safety of the public.","Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets []. A. Background On April 29, 2021, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was in Mode 6 for a refueling outage. A pressurizer [PZR] safety valve (PSV) [RV] in the reactor coolant system (RCS) [AB] was being tested in accordance with the HNP Inservice Testing Program. The HNP design has a total of three PSVs. One PSV is scheduled for testing each refueling outage on a rotating basis. The PSVs were manufactured by Crosby, model HB-BP 86. On March 30, 2020, it was discovered that the PSV serial number in service for 1RC-123 was the same PSV that was previously identified with an operating history of being outside of the TS allowed tolerance when tested, based upon an investigation competed in March 2015. The corrective action to address the PSV??¢s history of significant setpoint drift was to retire the PSV from service. The corrective action was not implemented due to a personnel error. The PSV was inadvertently reinstalled in the 2016 fall refueling outage with an acceptable lift setting. While the potential for drift in the PSV was recognized in March 2020, it was concluded that the PSV was operable, based upon a review of the installed as- left lift setting and the historical drift amount observed on this PSV. However, upon testing the PSV??¢s lift setpoint in the current refueling outage, it was discovered that the setpoint had drifted further than anticipated. The PSV exhibited increasing amounts of setpoint drift. The PSV has been removed from service and will be retired. No other systems, structures or components were inoperable at the time that contributed to the event. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as ?Å“any operation or condition which was prohibited the plant??¢s Technical Specifications,??because there is evidence the PSV lift setting was outside of the tolerance prescribed by TS prior to discovery. B. Event Description 1RC-123 was tested on April 29, 2021, and found with a lift setting of -1.3 percent (%) from its setpoint, which is outside the TS allowed tolerance of +/-1%. A spare PSV was installed in the 1RC-123 location, which was confirmed to be left within the allowed tolerance of +/-1% and does not have a history of significant setpoint drift. The specific date and time that the PSV became out of tolerance is not known and cannot be determined. Testing of the PSV is accomplished by removing the PSV from the system during a refueling outage and having the PSV tested by a vendor. Therefore, the testing does not cause a system transient. There were no automatically or manually initiated safety system responses due to the out of tolerance condition identified. C. Causal Factors The cause of the PSV lift setting being outside of the TS allowed tolerance is a personnel error that resulted in inadvertent installation of a PSV that had previously demonstrated a significant amount of setpoint drift. In each of the last five tests, the PSV failed low with as-found values ranging from -1.09% to -1.45% below the setpoint. The lift setting drift is specific to the PSV in question and not applicable to the entire population of PSVs. D. Corrective Actions The PSV was replaced with another PSV confirmed to have a lift setting within the TS allowed tolerance and no history of significant setpoint drift. The PSV with an operating history of being outside TS tolerance will be retired from service.",4002021004R00,4002021004R00,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications
Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant,1,Past Inoperability of Effluent Accident Monitor Exceeded Time Allowed by Technical Specifications,6/22/2021,"On June 22, 2021, the Waste Processing Building (WPB) Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was found to have incorrect database values used for flow rate measurement, which rendered this monitor inoperable. The database values for this radiation monitor were immediately corrected upon discovery of this condition and operability was restored on June 22, 2021. Following investigation, it was determined that this radiation monitor was inoperable since October 6, 2020. During completion of a surveillance test on this radiation monitor on October 6th, the database values were restored incorrectly. Maintenance personnel did not recognize a note in the Radiation Monitor Data Sheet Library that requires substitute values to be entered when the flow transmitter for this radiation monitor is inoperable. Since this radiation monitor was not known to be inoperable from October 6, 2020, through June 22, 2021, no alternate method for monitoring was implemented and no special report was completed as required by Technical Specifications (TS). The WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor is credited as one of two WPB exhaust effluent monitors in TS Table 3.3-10, Accident Monitoring Instrumentation.

The WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor is credited as one of two WPB exhaust effluent monitors in Technical Specification (TS) Table 3.3-10, Accident Monitoring Instrumentation, that are required to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3, in accordance with TS 3.3.3.6. The WPB exhaust effluent monitors provide an indication to operations personnel of the overall airborne activity in the WPB effluent at release points 5 and 5A. During the time period that the WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was inoperable, either the WPB Vent Stack 5 High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was operable or its alternate preplanned monitoring method was implemented. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as ?Å“any operation or condition which was prohibited the plant??¢s Technical Specifications,??because there is evidence the WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was inoperable for greater than the time allowed by HNP TS prior to discovery. Additionally, TS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.0.4 requires all LCOs to be met for the plant condition to be entered, prior to entry. There has been an unplanned forced outage, a planned refueling outage, and a planned forced outage at HNP since October 6, 2020. On these occasions, HNP was returned to Mode 3 without personnel being aware of this condition and the LCO for TS 3.3.3.6 was not met, which is prohibited by TS LCO 3.0.4. B. Event Description On June 22, 2021, the WPB Vent Stack 5A High Range Noble Gas Radiation Monitor was found to have incorrect database values used for flow rate measurement, which rendered this monitor inoperable. The flow transmitter [FT] used for this radiation monitor has been inoperable since July 7, 2020, which requires use of pre-established substitute values in the database to maintain operability of this radiation monitor. On June 22, 2021, a Radiation Protection (RP) technician identified that the database values used for monitoring flow that supports this radiation monitor??¢s monitoring function were not appropriate, as the values being used were for the flow transmitter being in an operable status. From investigation, the incorrect database values were present since October 6, 2020, when personnel conducting a surveillance test activity on this radiation monitor inadvertently entered incorrect database values. Maintenance personnel did not recognize a note in the Radiation Monitor Data Sheet Library that requires substitute values to be entered when the flow transmitter for this radiation monitor is inoperable.

Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant,1,Essential Services Chilled Water Chiller Inoperable Due to Pre-Rotation Vane Actuator Control Arm Position,1/10/2022,"On January 10, 2022, a Reactor Auxiliary Building operator for the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, noted that the 'A' Train Essential Services Chilled Water System chiller??¢s compressor pre-rotation vane (PRV) was mispositioned. This resulted in the chiller being declared inoperable at 07:57 on January 10th. Maintenance personnel identified that the PRV control arm had slipped at its tapered connection to the associated control shaft due to reduced torque on the cap screw holding it in place. The chiller was declared operable on January 11th at 21:09, following successful completion of corrective maintenance. The cause of the slippage was inadequate guidance within maintenance procedure CM-M0259, ""Essential Chiller Compressor Maintenance,"" which presented a latent error trap for installation of the cap screw over an adjacent cam plate. This resulted in torque loss on the fastener while the chiller was in operation. The cap screw was previously installed during a maintenance activity involving a replacement of the compressor and the PRV actuator in August 2021. To address this condition, the cap screw was retorqued to proper specification and the adjacent cam plate was validated to no longer interfere with the cap screw. CM-M0259 was revised to provide guidance for proper cap screw installation.","Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets []. A. Background On January 10, 2022, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP) in Mode 1 and at 100% power, a Reactor Auxiliary Building (RAB) [NF] operator noted that the 'A' Train Essential Services Chilled Water (ESCW) [KM] chiller??¢s [CHU] compressor pre-rotation vane (PRV) [CMP] control arm [DRIV] was mispositioned while the unit was shutdown. No other systems, structures, or components were inoperable at the time that contributed to the event. The ESCW System circulates chilled water to the safety related cooling coils [CCL] of the air handling units [AHU] serving their respective heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for transfer of the thermal loads generated in the various areas of the plant to the Service Water System [BI]. Areas include the control room [VI], RAB electrical equipment protection rooms [VF], RAB switchgear rooms [VF], and other engineering safety feature (ESF) [JE] equipment areas [VF].

Event Description On January 10, 2022, a RAB operator noted that the 'A' Train chiller??¢s compressor PRV control arm was mispositioned while the 'A' Train chiller was shutdown. Maintenance personnel identified that the PRV control arm had slipped at its tapered connection to the associated control shaft [DRIV] due to reduced torque on the cap screw [DRIV] holding it in place. Investigation into the event identified that the PRV control arm had slipped when the 'A' Train chiller was started on December 27, 2021. The chiller continued to run normally, however the slippage resulted in reduced available chiller cooling capacity to respond to a design basis event. Further, the chiller would have been unable to restart if it tripped, which is an expected occurrence when responding to certain design basis events. The chiller was declared inoperable at 07:57 on January 10th when the deficient condition was identified.

Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant,1,Manual Reactor Trip due to Degrading Condenser Vacuum,4/29/2022,"On April 29, 2022, at 04:05 Eastern Daylight Time, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to degrading condenser vacuum approaching the turbine trip setpoint. The trip was not complex, with all systems responding normally post-trip. The Reactor Protection System and Auxiliary Feedwater System actuated as designed. A monthly swap of the Main Condenser Air Removal System vacuum pumps (CVPs) was in progress at the time of this event. When the 'B' CVP was secured, the suction isolation valve, 1AE-16, and the 'B' CVP discharge check valve, 1AE-19, failed to close, resulting in a rapid decrease in condenser vacuum. The rate of vacuum degradation did not allow time for manual isolation prior to the manual reactor trip. The root cause of this event is the combination of two simultaneous equipment failures, resulting in a large volume of main condenser air-in-leakage. The 1AE-16 failure cause is indeterminate; however, the likely cause is an intermittent malfunction of the control relay associated with the solenoid operated valve (SOV) that controls 1AE-16 actuator operation. The 1AE-19 failure cause is attributed to poor valve construction with the disk arm not being centered, resulting in contact between the disc and valve body. Corrosion product buildup along this contact surface caused valve binding. The CVP operating procedure was revised to close the CVP manual suction isolation valve prior to securing the CVP. Control relays and a circuit breaker mechanism operated cell assembly for 1AE-16 were replaced. 1AE-19 was replaced. The 1AE-16 SOV and the ??A??CVP discharge check valve will be replaced.","Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets []. A. Background Prior to the event, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the time of this event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as ?Å“Any event or condition that resulted in manual actuation or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of [10 CFR 50.73]...??due to actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JC] and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) [BA]. All actuated safety systems functioned as designed. The Main Condenser Air Removal System [SH] vacuum pumps (CVPs) [P] are designed to establish and maintain condenser vacuum and to remove non-condensable gases during plant operation. Condenser vacuum is normally maintained at approximately 2 to 4 inches of mercury (Hg) absolute to minimize condenser back pressure. Operating with high back pressure may cause overheating of the turbine [TRB] elements, which could lead to distortion of the rotor and/or turbine blading. There are two 100 percent capacity two-stage liquid ring type CVPs that require seal water to function. The seal water provides inlet spray at the inlet of the pump first stage which condenses vapors before they enter the main pump body. Airflow passes from the compression stages into the moisture separator [SEP] tank [TK]. The moisture separator tank allows the air to separate from the water in the discharge of the CVPs. Air is discharged to the Turbine Building vent stack. The water remains in the moisture separator tank and serves as a reservoir for the seal water supply. Each CVP has an air-operated suction valve [ISV] that isolates the CVPs from the condenser. Each of the suction valves will open with the start of the associated CVP and will close when the CVP is secured. There is a check valve [V] on the outlet of each moisture separator tank that prevents reverse flow when the CVP is shut down. This check valve provides a backup to the CVP suction valve to prevent reverse flow through the moisture separator tank and CVP. The air-operated suction valve is an air-to-open, spring-to-close butterfly valve with a piston actuator. The air supplied to the valve actuator is controlled by a solenoid-operated valve (SOV) [SOL]. When the CVP is in operation, the SOV is energized and supplying air to the actuator that opens the valve to provide a path to the condenser for drawing a vacuum. When the CVP is off, the SOV is de-energized, which vents the air from the actuator, allowing the actuator spring to close the valve. B. Event Description On April 29, 2022, at 04:05 Eastern Daylight Time, the reactor was manually tripped due to degrading condenser vacuum approaching the turbine trip setpoint. The trip was not complex, with all systems responding normally post-trip. The RPS and AFWS actuated as designed. A monthly swap of the CVPs was in progress at the time of this event. Prior to the pump swap, the ??B??CVP was in operation with condenser pressure in the normal range of 3-4 inches Hg absolute and stable. To begin the CVP swap sequence, the ??A??CVP was started at 03:59. Condenser pressure remained normal and stable following the pump start. Approximately 2 minutes later, at 04:01, the ??B??CVP was secured and CVP effluent flow began to increase within 5 seconds.

Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant,1,Both Trains of High Head Safety Injection Inoperable,5/2/2022,"On May 2, 2022, at 02:26 Eastern Daylight Time, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, testing was being performed in accordance with site procedure OST-1093, ?Å“Chemical Volume Control System/ Safety Injection System Operability Train B.??When Charging Safety Injection Pump (CSIP) discharge cross-connect valve 1CS-220 was stroked closed, the Main Control Room (MCR) received alarm ALB-008/2-1, Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) seal injection low flow, and seal injection flow was lowering to zero. Valve 1CS-220 was immediately restored to the open position and seal injection flows recovered to normal within approximately 23 seconds. Further investigation identified that the ??B??CSIP discharge valve, 1CS-197, was locked shut from prior post-maintenance testing instead of being in its required open position, the result of not validating assumptions related to a ??B??CSIP clearance. With 1CS-197 locked shut when 1CS-220 was stroked closed, both ??A??Train high head safety injection (HHSI) and ??B??Train HHSI were inoperable until 1CS-220 could be restored to open. This was a violation of Technical Specification (TS) requirements to have at least one CSIP operable to meet TS 3.1.2.2, TS 3.1.2.4, and TS 3.5.2 in Modes 1, 2, and 3. If a condition occurred that initiated a safety injection signal while 1CS-220 was closed in accordance with test procedure OST-1093, an operator in the MCR would procedurally restore the valve to its open position, restoring the ??A??CSIP and its discharge path for the Emergency Core Cooling System to operable. This event did not impact plant safety and there was no actual safety consequence on the health and safety of the public as a result of this event.","Note: Applicable Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets []. A. Background Prior to the event, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power, following recovery from a manual reactor trip on April 29, 2022, due to lowering condenser vacuum. At the time of the event, the ??B??Charging Safety Injection Pump (CSIP)[P] discharge isolation valve 1CS-197 [ISV] was shut instead of being in its required open position.

The ECCS consists of multiple water reservoirs and redundant flow paths to provide emergency borated cooling water directly to the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] subsequent to a loss of coolant accident (LOCA), main steam line break, or other event affecting RCS inventory. The primary function of the ECCS is to remove the stored and fission product decay heat from the reactor core during accident conditions. This system functions in conjunction with the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System [BP] as low head safety injection [BP] and the Chemical Volume and Control System (CVCS)[CB] as HHSI. The high head pumps deliver flow through the boron injection tank [TK] to the RCS. HNP Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.2.4 requires at least two CSIPs to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3. With only one CSIP operable, the site must restore at least two CSIPs to operable status within 72 hours or in accordance with the Risk- Informed Completion Time Program or be in at least hot standby and borated to a shutdown margin as specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR) at 200Ã‚Â°F within the next 6 hours. Furthermore, at least two CSIPs must be restored to operable status within the next 7 days or be in hot shutdown within the next 6 hours. HNP TS 3.1.2.2 requires at least two of the following three boron injection flow paths to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3: a) the flow path from the boric acid tank via a boric acid transfer pump and a CSIP to the RCS; and b) two flow paths from the refueling water storage tank via CSIPs to the RCS. With only one of the above required boron injection flow paths to the RCS operable, the site must restore at least two boron injection flow paths to the RCS to operable status within 72 hours or in accordance with the Risk-Informed Completion Time Program or be in at least hot standby and borated to a shutdown margin as specified in the COLR at 200Ã‚Â°F within the next 6 hours. Furthermore, at least two flow paths must be restored to operable status within the next 7 days or be in hot shutdown within the next 6 hours. HNP TS 3.5.2 requires two independent ECCS subsystems to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3, with each subsystem comprised of: a) one operable CSIP; b) one operable RHR heat exchanger; c) one operable RHR pump; and d) an operable flow path capable of taking suction from the refueling water storage tank on a Safety Injection signal and, upon being manually aligned, transferring suction to the containment sump during the recirculation phase of operation.

All actuated safety systems functioned as designed. The HNP condensate system [SD] and feedwater system [SJ] design includes two redundant trains each with a condensate pump (CP) [SD P], a condensate booster pump (CBP), and a main feedwater pump (MFP) [SJ P]. The CPs take suction from the main condenser [COND] hotwell. The discharge from both CPs combine and flow to the suction of both CBPs. The discharge of the CBPs flow through a series of feedwater heaters [ SJ HX] and combines with the discharge of the heater drain pumps [SN P] to provide suction to the two MFPs. The MFPs discharge flow through two additional feedwater heaters, and then the flow is separated into three lines to provide inventory to the three steam generators [SGs]. The HNP condensate system and feedwater system design results in a trip of the associated CBP and MFP following a CP trip when both MFPs are in service. B.

Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant,1,Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Inoperability,10/27/2022,"At 20:50 Eastern Daylight Time on October 27, 2022, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), in Mode 3, conditions existed such that all auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pumps were declared inoperable. The capability to throttle flow to the 'B' steam generator was not maintained due to improper operation of a flow control valve, 1AF-51, which is located in the discharge piping line to the `B' steam generator from the common header of the motor-driven AFW pumps. Since 1AF-51 operation can impact AFW flow control from the common header of the motor-driven AFW pumps, both motor-driven AFW pumps were declared inoperable. The turbine-driven AFW pump was inoperable at the time of this event due to incomplete post-maintenance testing following planned maintenance. The motor-driven AFW pumps were able to supply discharge flow to the steam generators during this event since the 1AF-51 failure never impacted the valve's ability to open. Based upon the declared inoperability of all three AFW pumps, this condition was reported on October 28, 2022, under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident, by event notification number 56186. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public. The cause of the 1AF-51 inoperability was an actuator malfunction. The actuator for 1AF-51 was replaced to restore proper flow control capability.","Note: Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text within brackets []. A. Background Prior to the event, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was operating in Mode 3 following completion of a refueling outage. The turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump [BA P] was inoperable at the time of this event. No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the time that contributed to the event. AFW system [BA] operability ensures that the reactor coolant system (RCS) [AB] can be cooled down to less than 350 degrees Fahrenheit from normal operating conditions so that the residual heat removal (RHR) system [BP] may be placed into operation. The AFW system provides decay heat removal immediately following a station blackout event, and is required to mitigate the loss of normal feedwater [SJ] and feedwater line break accidents analyzed in the HNP Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The flow control valve, 1AF-51 [FCV], is normally open and is located in the discharge piping line to the ??B??steam generator [SG] from the common header of the motor-driven AFW pumps [BA Ps]. This valve must be capable of automatically opening, if closed or throttled closed for low power or shutdown of feedwater flow, upon generation of any signal which starts the motor-driven AFW pumps. This function is necessary to provide a path for AFW flow to the associated steam generator. An electrohydraulic hydramotor actuator is used to control 1AF-51 position that energizes-to-close and returns open by a spring upon decrease in control signal or interruption of control power. 1AF-51 must also be capable of automatic closure on receipt of an AFW isolation signal. This isolation function protects against feeding AFW to a faulted steam generator and assures that minimum required flow is directed to the unaffected steam generators for the RCS cooldown. The valve is installed in series with an isolation valve, 1AF-93 [ISV], that receives its power supply from a separate engineered safety features (ESF) [JE] bus to ensure isolation of a faulted steam generator in the event of a single active failure of either valve. The HNP Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.1.2 limiting condition for operation (LCO) requires at least three independent steam generator AFW pumps and associated flow paths to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3. With one AFW pump inoperable, action must be taken to restore the required AFW pumps to operable status within 72 hours or in accordance with the risk-informed completion time program or to be in at least hot standby within the next 6 hours and in hot shutdown within the following 6 hours. With two AFW pumps inoperable, action must be taken to be in at least hot standby within 6 hours and in hot shutdown within the following 6 hours. With three AFW pumps inoperable, action must be taken immediately to initiate corrective action to restore at least one AFW pump to operable status as soon as possible. Based upon the declared inoperability of all three AFW pumps, this condition was reported under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident, by event notification number 56186. This condition is also reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as ?Å“any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: ??D) mitigate the consequences of an accident.??Based upon 1AF-51 demonstrating the same control malfunction following the reactor trip on October 30, 2022, at 06:53 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) as it did on October 27, 2022, HNP personnel have concluded that 1AF-51 was inoperable while HNP was in Modes 1, 2, and 3 beginning from the initial Mode 3 entry ascending on October 27, 2022, at 13:32 EDT through October 31, 2022, at 11:22 EDT.

The ??B??MFP was not in service and with the loss of the last running MFP, the auxiliary feedwater system actuated as designed. Safety systems functioned as required. This event did not impact public health and safety.

B. Event Description At 06:53 Eastern Daylight Time, with HNP in Mode 1, at approximately sixteen percent power following completion of a refueling outage, an automatic reactor trip occurred due to an under-voltage condition on the 'A' RCP and the 'C' RCP that resulted from a loss of power from the ??A??auxiliary bus.

When current was applied through the ??A??UAT to the ??A-3??cubicle, the differential current protective relay actuated, which actuated the lockout of the ??A??auxiliary bus. The wiring error occurred during maintenance activities on the CTs that were reinstalled during the refueling outage. C. Causal Factors The root cause of the CT wiring error was that the lift/land of leads for the CT maintenance was not performed in accordance with procedural guidance that requires unique cable identifiers for each lead lifted to ensure the as-found configuration would be replicated during the lead terminations. A contributing cause was that the lift/lead process lacked sufficient rigor to ensure configuration control. It was determined that the post-maintenance testing (PMT) following the maintenance activity was inadequate since it only included wire land verification. The development and approval of the PMT did not adequately address the potential consequences of bus de-energization for an incorrectly wired CT. This resulted in not identifying the need to perform additional checks or testing, which consequently led to not validating proper CT configuration.",4002022007R01,4002022007R01,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section

BVPS-2 was at approximately 90% power and in an end of cycle coast down. The Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically started as designed. The apparent cause was a premature failure of a Train A Solid State Protection System (SSPS) universal logic board (ULB) due to manufacturing defects with the solder joints which may have resulted in an intermittent loss of connection. This is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1) and an automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2) (iv)(B)(6). Corrective actions include replacement of the ULB, vendor testing of several ULBs within the SSPS, review of the final vendor test report for additional actions, and establishment of maintenance plans for periodic testing of the SSPS ULBs at both units.","NARRATIVE Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND The Solid State Protection System (SSPS) [JG] takes binary inputs (voltage/no voltage) from the process and nuclear instrument channels corresponding to conditions (normal/abnormal) of BVPS-2 parameters. The SSPS performs the decision logic for actuating a reactor trip or ESF actuation, generates the electrical output signal that will initiate the required trip or actuation, and provides the status, permissive, and annunciator output signals to the main control room of the unit. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT At 0632 on October 5, 2021, BVPS-2 automatically tripped with an initial annunciator indication of a Power Range Low Setpoint Neutron Flux High Reactor Trip. BVPS-2 was at approximately 90% power and in an end of cycle coast down. No equipment was inoperable at the start of the event that would have contributed to the event. The Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA] automatically started as designed. The trip was not complicated and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3. The trip was caused by an intermittent internal failure of the SSPS, specifically the loss of the reactor trip system interlock for power range neutron flux (P-10) and associated power range trip block signals. Troubleshooting was performed and three universal logic boards (ULBs) were replaced. Following the replacement, the SSPS was returned to service and BVPS-2 was put back online on October 8, 2021. The replaced ULBs along with several additional extent of condition ULBs from within both trains of the SSPS system were sent to Westinghouse for Westinghouse Automated Board Test System (WABTS) testing. The testing identified deficiencies in some of the ULBs. CAUSE OF EVENT Based on review of the Sequence of Events Log, the trip was generated within the Train A SSPS due to a loss of the reactor trip system interlock for power range neutron flux (P-10) and associated power range trip block signals. The direct cause of the trip was determined to be an internal failure of the A403 SSPS ULB.

The indications were not through-wall and there was no evidence of leakage at Penetrations 28 and 40 based on inspections performed on top of the reactor vessel head. Because the indications could not be dispositioned as acceptable per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code Section XI in a Reactor Coolant System pressure boundary, it was reported per Event Notification 55540 as a degraded condition per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) and is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A). Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) of the Alloy 600 penetration tube material was determined to be the cause of the identified flaws. Reactor vessel head Penetrations 28 and 40 were repaired in accordance with the applicable embedded flaw repair methodology approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for use at BVPS-2. A weld overlay of PWSCC resistant material was performed to isolate the indications from the borated water. The safety significance of these indications was very low.","Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT BVPS-2 was in a Defueled Mode. There were no systems, structures, or components that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. On October 2_2, 2021, during the BVPS-2 twenty-second refueling outage (2R22), it was determined that the results of ultrasonic examinations performed on Penetrations 28 and 40 of the reactor vessel head [AB-RPV] did not meet the applicable acceptance criteria. The indications were not through-wall and there was no evidence of leakage at Penetrations 28 and 40, based on inspections performed on top of the reactor vessel head. The examinations were being performed to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D) for reactor vessel head inspections. The intent is to identify potential flaws/indications well before the structural integrity of the reactor vessel head pressure boundary is significantly challenged. The ultrasonic examination determined that the circumferential indication on Penetration 28 of the reactor vessel head was between the 25.5 to 30.0 degree location with a maximum depth of 0.223 inches into the penetration tube. The ultrasonic examination determined that the axial indication on Penetration 40 of the reactor vessel head was at the 22.5 degree location with a maximum depth of 0.163 inches into the penetration tube. The reactor vessel head inspection is a requirement of 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D) which invokes ASME Code Case N-729-6. Ultrasonic examinations or eddy current examinations (as applicable) are performed on each of the 66 vessel head penetrations on the BVPS-2 head during each refueling outage until head replacement activities are completed in the future. Head Penetrations 28 and 40 were repaired as required prior to plant startup from 2R22. Ultrasonic examination results for the other 64 vessel head penetrations were acceptable. The indications identified on Penetrations 28 and 40 of the reactor vessel head were reported to the NRC per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) on October 22, 2021. (Event Notification 55540).

Beaver Valley Power Station,2,Unit 2 Manual Reactor Trip,11/12/2021,"At 1007 EST on November 12, 2021, with Unit 2 in Mode 1 at approximately 17 percent power following a refueling outage, the reactor was manually tripped due to increasing steam generator water levels due to oscillating Main Feedwater Pump Recirculation Valves. The oscillation of the valves led to a steam generator water level transient that met predefined reactor trip criteria. The direct cause was the key lock switches for the recirculation valves were left in AUTO allowing the valves to modulate based on flow indication. The apparent cause was the unit supervisor did not properly read a procedure step from a startup procedure and the step was not performed. This is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1). Corrective actions are procedural clarifications and cautions.","Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND The Main Feedwater Pump Recirculation Valves (2FWR-FCV150A and B) [JB] are each controlled by a CLOSE-AUTO- OPEN key switch located in the field near the valve. The key switch is normally maintained in AUTO to allow the valves to be controlled by flow switches in the suction line of the main feed pumps. Red (open) and Green (closed) indicating lights are provided on Benchboard Section C. The valve will manually open when its local control switch is placed in OPEN and will manually close when its local control switch is placed in CLOSE. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT At 1007 EST on November 12, 2021, the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit 2 (BVPS-2) reactor was manually tripped due to increasing steam generator [SB] water levels due to 2FWR-FCV150A and B oscillating. The oscillation of the valves led to a steam generator water level transient that met predefined reactor trip criteria. BVPS-2 was in Mode 1 at approximately 17 percent power following a refueling outage and no equipment was inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. The trip was not complicated, and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3. Prior to the event, at approximately 0040, a procedure step to verify that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were in OPEN was not performed, resulting in the key lock switches being left in AUTO. Reactor power was then raised from 5 percent over the next hour and a half to approximately 17 percent by 0200. A condenser steam dump/turbine bypass valve perturbation caused 2FWR-FCV150A and B to oscillate and then stabilize at approximately 0630. At approximately 0945 the valves began oscillating again resulting in steam generator water level increase, and the bypass feedwater regulating valves were placed in manual control to control the steam generator water level. At 1000, the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were placed in OPEN. The steam generator water levels reached the trip criteria before they were able to be stabilized and the plant was manually tripped at 1007. CAUSE OF EVENT On midnight shift during the performance of 2OM-52.4.A, ""Raising Power From 5% to Full Load Operation,"" revision 90, a step to verify that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were in the OPEN position was not performed properly, resulting in the key lock switches being left in AUTO. During turbine valve testing on the following shift, a condenser steam dump [JI] oscillation occurred that led to feedwater flow being lowered to the setpoint of 2FWR- FCV150A and B which caused the valves to oscillate. These oscillations led to the steam generator water level transient and subsequent manual reactor trip. The direct cause was that the key lock switches for 2FWR-FCV150A and B were left in AUTO allowing the valves to modulate based on flow indication.",4122021004R00,4122021004R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
Beaver Valley Power Station,2,Manual Reactor Trip and Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation due to trip of a Main Feedwater Pump,11/17/2021,"At 1313 on November 17, 2021, the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) reactor was manually tripped while at approximately 100 percent power following a trip of a main feedwater pump (MFP) caused by a loss of adequate suction pressure. A transient in the Heater Drain System occurred from a level increase in a Second Point Heater Drain Receiver Tank. The level fluctuation resulted in an unexpected actuation of the tank's low-low level switch, which tripped the Train A Heater Drain and Separator Drain Receiver Drain Pumps. The trip of these pumps reduced flow and lowered MFP suction pressure. The standby condensate pump was not available to automatically start on low MFP pressure. When the MFP tripped, operators manually tripped the reactor per procedure. With the spare condensate pump unavailable, MFP suction pressure was unable to be restored and the manual reactor trip was procedurally required. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1), and an automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6). Corrective actions include changes to procedural controls for conditional single point vulnerabilities and condensate pump alignments above 40% power.","Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND The heater drain pumps and separator drain receiver drain pumps along with the condensate pumps provide flow at sufficient pressure to the suction of the Main Feedwater Pumps (MFPs). BVPS-2 requires two condensate pumps in service at full power to provide adequate MFP suction pressure. A third standby condensate pump provides redundancy for any MFP suction flow transients that could challenge MFP operation and is normally aligned to auto-start on low MFP suction pressure. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT At 1313 on November 17, 2021 while at approximately 100 percent power, the BVPS-2 reactor was manually tripped following a trip of the 21B MFP [SJ] due to a loss of suction pressure. A transient in the Heater Drain System [SN] commenced at 1300 due to a level increase in the 21A Second Point Heater Drain Receiver Tank. The level fluctuation resulted in high tank level alarms in the control room at 1310, and due to the system perturbations an unexpected actuation of the tank's low-low level switch occurred at 1312, which by design tripped the 21A Heater Drain Pump and the 22A Separator Drain Receiver Drain Pump. The trip of these two pumps reduced flow and lowered MFP suction pressure. The standby third condensate pump [SD] was out of service for maintenance since prior to startup from refueling outage 2R22 on November 12, 2021, and was not available to automatically start on low MFP pressure. When the 21B MFP tripped on low suction pressure at 1313, Control Room operators recognized the loss of a running MFP outside of procedural requirements and manually tripped the reactor. The trip was not complicated and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3. All control rods [AA] fully inserted into the reactor core. The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) [BA] automatically actuated on low steam generator [SJ] water level as expected, and the AFW system performed as designed. There was no safety-related equipment inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. The standby third condensate pump was unavailable at the start of the event and this did contribute to the event. CAUSE OF EVENT The direct cause of the need to perform the manual reactor trip was the loss of MFP suction pressure resulting in an automatic trip of a running MFP. The apparent cause of this event is additional mitigating actions were not taken when the third condensate pump motor was not returned from the vendor as scheduled. Had the standby third condensate pump been available, it would have auto-started on low MFP suction pressure, preventing the trip of the running MFP, thus a manual reactor trip would not have been necessary. Not having the standby condensate pump available created a conditional single point vulnerability within the Condensate [SD] and Heater Drains systems that were not identified or mitigated.",4122021005R00,4122021005R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
Beaver Valley Power Station,2,Unit 2 Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specification and Loss of Safety Function due to Emergency Diesel Generator Fuel Oil Intrusion into Lube Oil,7/13/2022,"On July 13, 2022 while Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 was operating at 100 percent power, fuel oil intrusion was identified in the lube oil for emergency diesel generator (EDG) 2-2 following a declining trend in lube oil viscosity. Based on the fuel intrusion degrading the quality of the lube oil viscosity, it was determined that EDG 2-2 would not be able to meet its mission time of 30 days and EDG 2-2 was declared inoperable. The lube oil was changed and EDG 2-2 was declared operable on July 16, 2022. The gravity drain from the fuel oil injection pumps to the underground tank was found to have been air bound since the October 2021 refueling outage, which prevented excess fuel oil from the fuel oil injection pumps from draining back to the fuel oil storage tank and allowed for intrusion into the lube oil. The direct cause was a lack of guidance in station procedures to proactively open the gravity drain line vent valve(s) during filling of the fuel oil storage tank. The root cause was that the organization did not recognize the need to proactively open the gravity drain line vent valve(s) every time fuel oil is added to the fuel storage tank. Corrective actions include revising the station procedures used during the fuel oil tank drain and fill activity to provide guidance for venting the gravity drain lines after filling the tanks. This event is being reported as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) and as a loss of safety function under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) and (D).","Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) has two separate trains of emergency diesel generators (EDGs) [EK], both of which are required to be operable in mode 1 by Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1, AC Sources - Operating. Condition B for one EDG inoperable requires a surveillance to be performed for the operable offsite circuit(s) within 1 hour and then once every 8 hours, as well as restoration of the EDG to operable status within 72 hours. Additionally, TS 3.8.1 condition E with two EDGs inoperable requires one to be restored to operable status within 2 hours. Condition G requires shutdown of the Unit if the Required Action and Completion Time are not met. The EDG fuel oil injection pumps [DC-P] have a gravity drain to the underground fuel oil storage tank [DE-TK] which allows excess fuel oil from the pumps to return to the tank. This is routed such that there is an inverted U-shaped section of the piping which can trap air if drained. A normally closed vent valve is located on this section of pipe to release any trapped air. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT On July 13, 2022, while BVPS-2 was operating at 100 percent power, fuel oil intrusion was identified in the lube oil for EDG 2-2 following a declining trend in lube oil viscosity. Based on the information available at the time, there was reasonable assurance that EDG 2-2 would be able to fulfill its safety function and meet its mission time, and a follow-up operability determination was requested. During the follow-up operability determination, it was determined that EDG 2-2 would not be able to meet its mission time of 30 days based on the fuel oil intrusion degrading the quality of the lube oil, and EDG 2-2 was declared inoperable on July 13, 2022 at 2055 hours. During the investigation, the gravity drain from the fuel oil injection pumps to the underground tank was found to be air bound, which prevented excess fuel oil from the pumps from flowing back to the tank and allowed for intrusion into the lube oil [LA]. Three of these pumps were replaced and the gravity drain line was vented by opening the vent valve. The air bound condition existed since the most recent refueling outage in October 2021 following a required surveillance to empty, clean, and refill the EDG fuel oil storage tanks. Due to the decreasing viscosity of the lube oil as a result of the fuel oil intrusion, past operability is not supported for the approximate nine months from October 2021 to July 16, 2022. This condition was identified on the opposite train EDG 2-1 during the outage following a post-maintenance test (PMT) and corrected, therefore this condition did not exist on EDG 2-1 during the time period since the outage. EDG 2-2 did not show similar symptoms during its PMT and so was not investigated for a similar condition.",4122022001R00,4122022001R00,"50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(A), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(D)",,
Beaver Valley Power Station,2,Indications Identified During Reactor Vessel Head Inspection,4/22/2023,"On April 22, 2023, during the BVPS-2 twenty-third refueling outage (2R23), it was determined that two indications identified on the reactor pressure vessel head vent line did not meet the applicable acceptance criteria. Because the indications could not be dispositioned as acceptable per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code Section XI in a Reactor Coolant System pressure boundary, it was reported under Event Notification 56485 as a degraded condition per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) as a degraded condition, and is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A).

DESCRIPTION OF EVENT Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) was in a Defueled Mode. There were no systems, structures, or components that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. On April 22, 2023, during the BVPS-2 twenty-third refueling outage (2R23), it was determined that two indications identified on the reactor pressure vessel head [AB-RPV] vent line did not meet the applicable acceptance criteria. The reactor pressure vessel head examinations were performed to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D) and ASME Code Case N-729-6 to find potential flaws/indications before they grow to a size that could potentially jeopardize the structural integrity of the reactor vessel head pressure boundary. The eddy current examination results identified one radial linear indication 0.200"" long at the 38-degree circumferential location and one radial linear indication 0.160"" long at the 236-degree location. The degraded condition was reported to the NRC per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) on April 22, 2023 (Event Notification 56485). CAUSE OF EVENT Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) of the Alloy 600 penetration tube material was determined to be the cause of the identified flaws.

ANALYSIS OF EVENT Indications that cannot be dispositioned as acceptable per ASME Code Section XI in a Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] pressure boundary are reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) as a degraded condition. The plant risk associated with the BVPS-2 eddy current indications identified on the vent line penetration of the reactor vessel head is considered to be of very low safety significance. This is based on the fact that the indications were not through-wall and there was no indication of RCS leakage. The change in core damage frequency derived using the conditional core damage probability and the change in large early release frequency derived using conditional large early release probability for the observed condition are very small.",4122023001R00,4122023001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(ii)(A),Plant Degradation,"The condition of the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously degraded"
Beaver Valley Power Station,2,Automatic Actuation of Auxiliary Feedwater System,5/19/2023,"At 0852 on May 19, 2023, with Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) in Mode 3 at 0 percent power, an actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System occurred. Both Motor Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (MDAFW) Pumps automatically started as designed when a 'Loss of Both Main Feedwater Pumps (MFP)' signal was received upon the start failure of the 'B' MFP, 2FWS-P21B. The 2FWS-P216 failure to start was because the lube oil (LO) pressure start permissive was not met when the LO system relief valve, 2FWS-RV205B, setpoint was set too low during the refueling outage. Also, the MDAFW pump auto-start signal was able to be generated during a plant condition where it was not necessary. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in the automatic actuation of the AFW System, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6). Planned corrective actions include adjusting 2FWS-RV2056 setpoint to restore LO system margin and start-up procedures will be revised to disable the MDAFW Pump auto-start circuit when plant conditions do not require the auto-start function. Also, maintenance documents will be enhanced to clarify the desired setpoint value.","Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND The Steam Generator Feedwater System (FWS) [SJ] supplies heated feedwater to the steam generators [SG] under all load conditions maintaining level within the programmed band. Two 50 percent capacity motor-driven Main Feedwater Pumps (MFPs) [SJ-P], 2FWS-P21A and 2FWS-P216, supply sufficient feedwater flow to the three steam generators for full power operation. Each MFP has a lube oil (LO) system which consists of a reservoir, a shaft-driven pump, an auxiliary motor-driven pump, a relief valve, an oil cooler, and the necessary piping, valves and instrumentation. Oil is normally supplied by the shaft-driven LO pump. The auxiliary motor-driven LO pump provides lubrication requirements during startup and as a backup to the shaft-driven pump. The LO system relief valve [SJ-RV] maintains the LO system operating pressure. The MFP start circuit requires sufficient LO pressure to enable the start permissive to be met when starting a MFP. On a 'Loss of both Main Feedwater Pump(s)' signal, the Motor Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (MDAFW) Pumps [BA-P] auto start to provide feedwater flow to the steam generators to remove decay heat from the Reactor Coolant System [AB]. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT At 0852 on May 19, 2023, with Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) at 0 percent power in Mode 3 during the twenty-third refueling outage (2R23), Operations attempted to start the 'B' MFP, 2FWS-P21B, per plant start-up procedures. When 2FWS-P21B failed to start with the 'A' MFP, 2FWS-P21A, secured, a 'Loss of Both Main Feedwater Pump(s)' signal was received and the 'A' and 'B' MDAFW Pumps started as designed. There was no safety-related equipment inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. Following the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) actuation, the MDAFW Pumps were secured and returned to auto by the control room operators. CAUSE OF EVENT The direct cause for 2FWS-P216 failing to start was that the LO pressure start permissive was not met. This was because the LO system relief valve, 2FWS-RV2056, setpoint was set too low during 2R23. 2FWS-RV2056 had been replaced during 2R23 and the new relief valve had been set to 10.83 psig which is at the low end of the 10 ??14 psig range prescribed by the setpoint documents. The LO system pressure needs to be at least 12 psig to meet the start permissive of the MFPs. A contributing cause is that the setpoint document and the PM replacement order incorrectly document the relief valve setpoint as 12 psig and not that the LO system operating pressure is to be at least 12 psig. A second contributing cause to the consequence of the event was that the MDAFW pump auto-start signal was able to be generated during a plant condition where it was not necessary.",4122023002R00,4122023002R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
??,Unknown Unit,Missile Barrier Door Left Open Resulting in a Loss of Safety Function,6/11/2023,"On June 11, 2023, while Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, a missile shield door was discovered to have been left open since April 6, 2023 and prior to the start of the spring 2023 refueling outage. Both Primary Component Cooling Water trains were inoperable for the period between April 7, 2023 to April 9, 2023, and May 14, 2023 to June 11, 2023. This was reported via Event Notification 56569 as an unanalyzed condition and a loss of safety function. The direct cause of the door being left open is station personnel did not adequately track ownership of the door over the multi- day evolution. Personnel did not follow the procedure when they failed to assume ownership of the door and shut the door at the end of the work activity. The root cause is the organization did not have a clear and concise process for controlling ownership and responsibility for missile shield doors when temporarily opened. Corrective actions include adding a check that the door is closed to the daily tour log, creating a specific procedure for opening and closing the door, and adding controls to the administrative procedure, including a dedicated closure team requirement until doors are restored to closed and latched.","Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND Door A-35-5A [NF-DR] is a credited tornado missile barrier for the Primary Auxiliary Building (PAB) and protects both trains of Primary Component Cooling Water (CCP) [CC]. The normal alignment for this door is closed and latched; however, it could be opened under administrative control in accordance with site procedure 1/2-ADM-2021, ""Control of Penetrations (Including HELB Doors)."" When opening the door during Modes 1-4, 1/2-ADM-2021, revision 15 required that the work group is briefed to close the door at the end of the work period and a Narrative Log entry is made stating that equipment required to close the door is staged and identifies the responsible work group. In the event of a tornado watch, the Shift Manager is required to direct the work group to close and secure the door. When the door is closed, the responsible work group is required to report the closure to the control room and a Narrative Log entry is made stating that the door is shut. When opening the door during Mode 5, the Narrative Log entry also states that the door shall be shut and latched prior to entry into Mode 4. Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.7 requires two trains of CCP to be operable in Modes 1-4. With one train inoperable, Condition A requires the CCP train to be restored to operable status within 72 hours or the unit must go to Mode 3 in 6 hours and Mode 5 in 36 hours. With both trains inoperable in Modes 1-4, LCO 3.0.3 applies requiring the unit to be placed in a Mode or other specified condition in which LCO 3.7.7 is not applicable. If inadequate residual heat removal (RHR) [BP) capability exists in Mode 4, then LCO 3.7.7 Condition C applies and requires immediate action to restore one train of CCP. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT On June 11, 2023, while Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, credited tornado missile barrier door A-35-5A was discovered to be open and was subsequently closed and latched. A loss of safety function was declared for the CCP system. This was reported via Event Notification 56569 as an unanalyzed condition and an event that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function to remove residual heat. A past operability review determined that operability of the CCP system could not be supported while the door was open during the Modes of TS applicability and both CCP trains were determined to have been inoperable for that period. At 0838 on April 6, 2023, while BVPS-2 was in Mode 1 coasting down to enter its twenty-third refueling outage (2R23), the door was authorized to be opened to move equipment. This was documented in the Narrative Log in accordance with 1/2- ADM-2021 and the responsible work group was identified. The responsible work group was required to close the door after moving the equipment in accordance with the procedure; however, when the responsible work group completed the task they did not close the door. The door was not communicated as shut to the control room and there was no log entry stating that the door was shut.

Beaver Valley Power Station,2,Condition Prohibited by Technical Specification and Loss of Safety Function due to Emergency Diesel Generator Lube Oil Contamination by Fuel Oil,7/12/2023,"At 1617 on July 12, 2023, with Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) at 100 percent power in Mode 1, the 2-2 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) was declared Inoperable due to its Rocker Arm Lube Oil (LO) System viscosity degrading such that the required 30-day mission time would not be met. This was likely due to Fuel Oil System leakage into the Rocker Arm LO System from a loose fuel oil injection line packing nut. The effectiveness of torquing the packing nut was indeterminate during subsequent LO test results. Compensatory measures were implemented to monitor and maintain the LO viscosity within the required limit by a proceduralized drain and fill process that will be executed based on LO sample results and EDG run time. The 2-2 EDG was declared Operable at 0615 on July 15, 2023. This event is reportable as a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) and as a Loss of Safety Function per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) and (D). The additional planned corrective action is to implement a permanent repair if fuel oil leakage increases during continued monitoring. Enhancements include revising the maintenance procedures to check the tightness of fuel oil packing nuts and to replace the high-pressure fuel oil line O-rings and packing on both EDGs.","Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. BACKGROUND Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) has a Train ??A??and a Train ??B??Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) [EK] to power their respective emergency buses and associated Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) Systems. The redundant trains ensure the minimum safety functions will be performed with either EDG Operable. The EDG Lube Oil (LO) System [LA] provides lubrication to the main bearings, crank pins, camshaft bearing, and other oil- lubricated wearing parts within the EDG. The EDG LO System also includes a Rocker Arm LO System that provides lubrication for the rocker arms and valve gear while the EDG is operating. The Rocker Arm LO reservoir level is maintained by the EDG LO System through a level control valve. Leakage from the Fuel Oil System [DC] injectors or fuel oil line connections may cause fuel oil to contaminate the Rocker Arm LO System. Fuel oil contamination above 6.17 percent into the Rocker Arm LO System degrades the required viscosity for the LO to perform its function. Technical Specification LCO 3.8.1, ?Å“AC Sources ??Operating?? requires two EDGs in Modes 1-4. If one required EDG is Inoperable, the required action per the Technical Specification Bases is to restore the EDG within 72 hours or shutdown the unit to Mode 3 within 6 hours and Mode 5 within 36 hours. Technical Specification LCO 3.8.2, ?Å“AC Sources ??Shutdown?? requires one EDG in Modes 5 and 6. If the required EDG is Inoperable, the required action is to suspend core alterations and positive reactivity additions, and to restore the EDG immediately. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT On July 12, 2023, with BVPS-2 at 100 percent power in Mode 1, an increased amount of fuel oil at a concentration of 3.7 percent was discovered during lube oil analysis of the 2-2 EDG Rocker Arm LO reservoir. This LO sample had been obtained on June 28, 2023, and was a step change from the 1.9 percent concentration identified in a previous sample obtained on April 19, 2023. With a calculated leak rate of 0.082 percent / hour, the 2-2 EDG would have been capable of operating for approximately 3.13 days until the maximum calculated dilution of 6.17 percent was met. The 2-2 EDG would not have been able to meet its mission time of 30 days; therefore, the 2-2 EDG was declared Inoperable at 1617 on July 12, 2023. No observable leakage was found during troubleshooting to identify the source of leakage. However, the fuel injection line packing nut on cylinder No. 11 was found loose and tightened two revolutions. LO samples were taken during the subsequent nine-hour 2-2 EDG maintenance run completed on July 14, 2023. Based on the LO sample test results, it is indeterminate if the leak had been repaired or if residual fuel oil remained present in the LO system during the EDG run.",4122023004R00,4122023004R00,"50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(A), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(D)",,
Catawba Nuclear Station,1,Automatic Actuation of the 1B Emergency Diesel Generator Load Sequencer on Bus Undervoltage Condition,10/27/2021,"On October 27, 2021, at approximately 1430, with Unit 1 in Mode 6 at 0% power, the 1B Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) Load Sequencer was actuated by a valid undervoltage condition on the 1B 4160v Essential Bus that occurred during 1B sequencer timer calibration activities.  Valid actuation signals were sent to both the 1B EDG and the Unit 1 Auxiliary Feedwater (CA) System.  Neither system automatically started as they were both removed from service for maintenance activities at the time. Decay heat removal was maintained via 1A train systems. During performance of the 1B EDG sequencer timer calibration, jumpers equipped with mini grabbers are used to place the sequencer into a test configuration.  The cause of the event is the mini grabber placed during the testing activity lost adequate connection which allowed the load sequencer to realign from the test condition.

This event is being reported under the following criterion: 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), for any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of the PWR auxiliary feedwater system and the emergency AC electrical power system. Engineered Safety Features Actuation System [JE](ISE), Diesel Generator Load Sequencer [EK] (EQB)(EQC) The onsite standby power source for each 4160 volt Engineered Safety Features (ESF) bus at Catawba is a dedicated Diesel Generator [DG] (DG). For each unit, DGs A and B are dedicated to ESF buses ETA and ETB, respectively. Each DG starts automatically on a Safety Injection (SI) signal (i.e., low pressurizer pressure or high containment pressure) or on an ESF bus degraded voltage or undervoltage signal. After the DG has started, it will automatically tie to its respective bus after offsite power is tripped as a consequence of ESF bus undervoltage or degraded voltage, independent of or coincident with an SI signal. With no SI signal, there is a ten-minute delay between the degraded voltage signal and the DG start signal. The DGs will also start and operate in the standby mode without tying to the ESF bus on an SI signal alone. Following the trip of offsite power, a sequencer strips loads from the ESF bus. When the DG is tied to the ESF bus, loads are then sequentially connected to its respective ESF bus by the automatic load sequencer. The sequencing logic controls the permissive and starting signals to motor breakers to prevent overloading the DG by automatic load application. In the event of a loss of preferred power, the ESF electrical loads are automatically connected to the DGs in sufficient time to provide for safe reactor shutdown and to mitigate the consequences of a Design Basis Accident (DBA) such as a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). Certain required unit loads are returned to service in a predetermined sequence in order to prevent overloading the DG in the process. Approximately one minute after the initiating signal is received, all loads needed to recover the unit or to maintain it in a safe condition are returned to service. Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA](CA) The Auxiliary Feedwater System assures sufficient feedwater supply to the steam generators in the event of loss the condensate/feedwater system, to remove energy stored in the core and primary coolant.

Catawba Nuclear Station,2,Indication Identified During Reactor Pressure Vessel Head Nozzle Penetration Inspection,4/20/2021,"On April 20, 2021, during the performance of the Catawba Nuclear Station Unit 2 reactor vessel closure head (RVCH) examinations, it was determined the Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 did not meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D) and ASME code case N-729-6. A relevant ultrasonic testing (UT) leak path indication was identified on Unit 2, nozzle penetration 74. The indication was confirmed in the J-groove weld with supplemental eddy current and liquid penetrant surface examinations. A bare metal visual examination of the RVCH was performed with no visual evidence of head penetration leakage detected. The cause of the Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 relevant indication is due to Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) from the Alloy 82/182 weld application in the primary system. Unit 2 RVCH nozzle penetration 74 was repaired in accordance with the NRC approved Westinghouse embedded flaw repair method (WCAP-15987-P-A) and Duke Energy relief request RA-21-0145.

Applicable Energy Industry Identification [EIIS] system and component codes are enclosed within brackets. Catawba Nuclear Station unique system and component identifiers are contained within parentheses. On April 20, 2021, Unit 2 of Catawba Nuclear Station (CNS) was in a scheduled refueling outage (Refueling, 0% power) for cycle 24 (C2R24). During the outage, the inspection of the reactor vessel closure head (RVCH) [RPV] penetration nozzles [NZL] occurred. The RVCH is a Westinghouse Design manufactured by Combustion Engineering. No Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to the event. No change in plant mode or in reactor power occurred as a result of this event. EVENT DESCRIPTION During the Catawba Spring 2021 outage, as a part of the ultrasonic examination (UT) for the in-service inspection at Catawba Nuclear Station Unit 2, a leak path indication was found in the reactor vessel head nozzle penetration 74. Subsequent, manual eddy current testing (ECT) examination revealed a single relevant circumferential linear indication on the surface of the J-groove weld approximately 0.8"" from the lowest point on the downhill side counter-clockwise looking up, and 0.5"" from the toe of the weld. Duke Energy performed a bare metal visual inspection in accordance with ASME Code Case N-729-6, Table 1, with no relevant visual indications indicative of nozzle leakage detected. The indication was identified on April 20, 2021, at 2230. A liquid penetrant (PT) examination was performed on the J-groove weld and confirmed a relevant indication located 0.8"" from the lowest point on the downhill side counter-clockwise looking up, and 0.6"" from the toe of the weld. The indication was described to be a ""rounded liquid penetrant indication 1/16 inch in diameter"". The ECT and PT surface examinations identified the relevant indication at the same position on the weld. As a result of the change in backwall reflectivity observed during the ultrasonic leak path assessment and the relevant indication detected by both supplemental surface examination methods (ECT and PT), repair of the J-groove weld was required during the refueling outage. Due to the relevant indication described above, a repair of the nozzle penetration 74 J-groove weld was necessary. The Westinghouse embedded flaw repair process was implemented for nozzle penetration 74. The embedded flaw repair process involves depositing weld material, which is Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) resistant, over the entire surface of the J-groove weld on the penetration nozzle of interest, as well as over the outside surface of the nozzle tube. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55a(z)(1), Duke Energy submitted relief request RA-21-0145, which proposed the repair of the J-groove weld of RVCH nozzle penetration 74 using an embedded flaw repair process as an alternative to the defect removal and weld repair provisions of ASME Section XI, IWA-4000 and ASME Section III, NB-4450. The proposed embedded flaw repair process is described in WCAP-15987-P-A. Duke Energy received NRC verbal authorization on April 24, 2021, for relief request RA-21-0145. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A), ""Any event or condition that results in the condition of the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously degraded"" because the linear indication did not meet the applicable acceptance criterion referenced in ASME Code Case N-729-6, as conditioned by 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D).",4142021001R00,4142021001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(ii)(A),Plant Degradation,"The condition of the nuclear power plant, including its principal safety barriers, being seriously degraded"
Catawba Nuclear Station,2,Valid Actuation of the Unit 2 Reactor Protection System and Auxiliary Feedwater System,5/1/2021,"At 0755 hours on May 1, 2021, during reactor coolant system temperature cross calibration testing activities, with Unit 2 in Mode 3 at 0 percent (not critical) power with all control rods fully inserted, Catawba Unit 2 received an automatic reactor trip signal on Overpower Delta Temperature. The trip was not complex, with all systems responding normally post-trip. As a result of the reactor trip signal, a feedwater isolation signal was generated. At 1013, on May 1, 2021, during feedwater recovery actions, with Unit 2 in Mode 3 at 0 percent power, the 2B Feedwater Pump Turbine tripped, which caused an actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (CA) system. The cause of the reactor trip signal was due to inadequacies in the reactor coolant system temperature cross calibration testing equipment and procedure. The cause of the CA system actuation was due to inadequate oversight and standards adherence of the Unit 2 feedwater isolation recovery actions. Corrective actions include procedural revisions and personnel accountability actions. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). There was no impact to the health and safety of the public.","BACKGROUND The following information is provided to assist readers in understanding the event described in this LER.

The applicable 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B) systems include the Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System. The Reactor Trip System automatically limits reactor operation to within a safe region by shutting down the reactor whenever the limits of the region are approached. Whenever a direct process or calculated variable exceeds a setpoint the reactor will be shutdown in order to protect against either gross damage to fuel cladding or loss of system integrity which could lead to release of radioactive fission products into the containment. The various reactor trip circuits automatically open the reactor trip breakers whenever a condition monitored by the Reactor Trip System reaches a preset level. The protection and monitoring systems have been designed to assure safe operation of the reactor. Each of the analyzed accidents and transients can be detected by one or more Reactor Trip System functions. One of the Reactor Trip System functions is Overpower Delta Temperature (OPDT). The OPDT trip function ensures that protection is provided to ensure the integrity of the fuel under all possible overpower conditions. This trip function also limits the required range of the Overtemperature Delta Temperature trip function and provides a backup to the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Setpoint trip. The OPDT trip function ensures that the allowable heat generation rate of the fuel is not exceeded. The OPDT trip function is calculated for each Reactor Coolant System loop, and Reactor Coolant System trip occurs if OPDT is indicated in two loops.

The LLRT was performed during the C2R24 refueling outage at which time primary containment was not required to be operable. The leakage assigned to the penetration also resulted in total containment leakage exceeding the allowed overall leakage (L ). The valves were repaired and retested a satisfactorily prior to entering the mode of applicability. The most likely cause of the leakages from 2MISV5230 and 2MISV5231 is the degradation of the elastomer seat aggravated by the presence of a buildup of debris in the seating area and overly conservative testing methodology.

On April 15, 2021, with Unit 2 of Catawba Nuclear Station (CNS) at 0 percent power (Mode 6) due to a refueling outage for cycle 24 (C2R24), the Unit 2 reactor building radiation monitor sample line containment penetration (2EMF-IN) failed its local leak rate test. The penetration failed to pressurize to the required test pressure due to excessive leakage through both the inboard and outboard containment isolation valves, 2MISV5231 and 2MISV5230 respectively (Valcor Model 04D-232 1 inch solenoid valves). Due to both primary containment isolation valves (PCIVs) in this penetration flow path failing to pressurize, a leakage value of L a was assigned to each valve, which represents a failure of the associated penetration, 2EMF-IN, to maintain containment integrity per Technical Specification 3.6.3, Containment Isolation Valves and specifically SR 3.6.3.8, to ""Verify the combined leakage rate for all reactor building bypass leakage paths is less than or equal to 0.07 L when pressurized to greater than or equal to 14.68 psig."" a Catawba Technical Specification 5.5.2, Containment Leakage Rate Testing Program requires a program shall be established to implement the leakage rate testing of the containment as required by 10 CFR 50.54(o) and 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Option B, as modified by approved exemptions.

BACKGROUND On October 15, 2022, Unit 2 of Catawba Nuclear Station was in a scheduled refueling outage (Mode 6, 0% power) for cycle 25 (C2R25). During the outage, a liquid penetrant (PT) surface examination was performed on the embedded flaw repair of nozzle [NZL] penetration 74 of the reactor vessel closure head (RVCH) [RPV] in accordance with the requirements of Catawba relief request RA-21-0144 (ML22020A283). The RVCH is a Westinghouse Design manufactured by Combustion Engineering. No Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to the event. No change in plant mode or in reactor power occurred as a result of this event. EVENT DESCRIPTION During the Catawba Unit 2 spring 2021 refueling outage (C2R24), an indication was discovered in the J-groove weld of RVCH nozzle penetration 74 which required repair. Catawba used the embedded flaw repair process, in accordance with the NRC approved WCAP-15987-P-A report, and Duke Energy relief request dated April 24, 2021 (RA-21-0145) to repair the weld. The embedded flaw repair process involves depositing weld material, which is Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) resistant, over the entire surface of the J-groove weld on the penetration nozzle of interest, as well as over the outside surface of the nozzle tube. On April 24, 2021 (ML21117A129), the NRC provided verbal authorization for the licensee's proposed alternative repair for one cycle of operation and by letter dated September 20, 2021 (ML21253A082), the NRC provided its follow-up safety evaluation for the verbal relief request. By letter dated January 20, 2022 (RA-21-0144), as supplemented by letter dated July 7, 2022, Catawba provided additional technical basis to support the continued use of the repair. Catawba made this request in accordance with 10 CFR 50.55a(z)(1) on the basis that the proposed alternative repair will provide an acceptable level of quality and safety. On August 31, 2022, Catawba was notified that the NRC staff had determined that the proposed alternative provided an acceptable level of quality and safety and authorized the use of the proposed alternative in RA-21-0144 through the remainder of the current fourth 10-year inservice inspection interval. During the Catawba Unit 2 fall 2022 refueling outage (C2R25), a PT surface examination was performed on the embedded flaw repair of nozzle penetration 74 of the RVCH in accordance with the requirements of Catawba relief request RA-21- 0144. On October 15, 2022, the examination identified indications which did not meet the applicable acceptance standards from ASME Section III, NB- 5350 and were therefore deemed rejectable. The indications were removed by buffing/grinding, localized weld build-up applied to restore the embedded flaw repair thickness, and a final PT of the locations was performed to ensure acceptance standards were met in the as-left condition.

In addition to the automatic monitoring and actuation of the protection system, a manual actuation circuit is also available to initiate a reactor shutdown. The manual trip consists of two switches (one for Train A and one for train B) in the control room. There are no interlocks that can block this trip. Auxiliary Feedwater System [BA] (CA) The Auxiliary Feedwater System is the assured source of feedwater to the steam generators during accident conditions. The CA System is designed to start automatically in the event of loss of offsite electrical power, trip of both main feedwater pumps, safety injection signal, or low-low steam generator water level; any of which may result in, coincide with, or be caused by a reactor trip. The CA System will supply sufficient feedwater to maintain the reactor at hot standby for two hours followed by cooldown of the Reactor Coolant System to the temperature at which the Residual Heat Removal System may be operated. Condenser Circulating Water [KE] (RC) The Condenser Circulating Water System supplies cooling water to the main and feedwater pump turbine condensers to condense the turbine exhaust steam. The rejected heat from the condensers is dissipated to the ambient surroundings by the cooling towers while meeting all applicable chemical and thermal effluent criteria.",4142022003R00,4142022003R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section

Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single spaced typewritten lines) On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the 'B' train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 31-1VRTN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. Because these fans support operability of the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and RPCCW systems, 72-hour Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS) were entered for one ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop being inoperable. When it became evident repairs could not be completed within the Technical Specification Allowed Outage Time (TS AOT), a request was made, and approved, for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion for 72 hours beyond the TS AOT to provide time to restore the fan and operability of ECCS and RPCCW. ECCS and RPCCW were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes. The cause of the fan failure was a failed motor bearing. The fan was repaired and restored to operable status on January 27, 2022 at 2050 hours. This condition is being reported pursuant to 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.

EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the 'B' train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 3HVR*FN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. This fan provides a support function for the Charging Pumps and RPCCW Pumps, as well as supporting operation of the Auxiliary Building Filter system and Supplemental Leak Collection and Release System (SLCRS). As a result of the fan tripping, Operations personnel entered the following Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS): ??TSAS 3.5.2.a for one Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) subsystem inoperable, which requires the inoperable subsystem to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 6 hours. ??TSAS 3.7.3 for one RPCCW safety loop inoperable, which requires the inoperable safety loop to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the following 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. ??TSAS 3.6.6.1 for one SLCRS system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. ??TSAS 3.7.9 for one Auxiliary Building Filter system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. Millstone Maintenance inspected the fan and found that the motor shaft was bent, causing the fan blades to contact the housing. After the failure was identified, repair activities proceeded on a continuous basis with the goal of completing the repairs and validating operability of the fan prior to expiration of the 72-hour Allowed Outage time (AOT) of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. However, as corrective maintenance activities to replace the fan motor and fan hub assembly progressed, completion of the repairs was forecasted to extend beyond the original 72-hour AOT. Therefore, on January 26, 2022, at approximately 0830 hours, Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut (DENC) informed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of the need for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) from the requirements of TS 3.5.2 and 3.7.3 for a period of 72 hours to avoid an unnecessary shutdown while repairs were completed. The NOED request was verbally approved by the NRC on January 26, 2022, at approximately 1034 hours. On January 27, 2022, at 2050 hours, corrective maintenance and post-maintenance testing of the fan was completed satisfactorily, the TSASs were exited, and the period of Notice Of Enforcement Discretion exited. One ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes, which exceeds the 72-hour AOT of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. Therefore, this event is being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. 2. CAUSE Investigation has determined that the fan failure was caused by a motor bearing failure. The failed bearing is manufactured by FAFNIR and its model number is 314KDD BEARING.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES MPS3 Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area exhaust fan 3HVR*FN13B is safety related but does not have any direct TS requirements. However, the fan does support the charging pump and RPCCW pump and heat exchangers, as well as the Auxiliary Building Filter and SLCRS systems, which are TS equipment. Therefore, this fan affects the TS for ECCS, RPCCW, SLCRS, and Auxiliary Building Filter System. The Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area supply and exhaust fans are part of the Auxiliary Building Filter System (ABFS). The fans are redundant, 100% capacity each. The fans provide an environment suitable for personnel access and equipment operation. It also controls and minimizes the potential for spread of airborne radioactive material within the building. In the event of a safety injection signal (SIS) or a containment depressurization actuation (CDA) signal, the auxiliary building general area ventilation is shutdown; the building outlet isolation dampers close; the Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area ventilation exhaust dampers close; the auxiliary building filter unit inlet and outlet dampers open; the filter exhaust fans start automatically; and the Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area supply and exhaust fans continue to operate venting through the turbine building stack via the Auxiliary Building Filter System (ABFS). An SIS signal also automatically starts operation of SLCRS. During accident conditions, the ABFS and SLCRS operate together to bring the secondary containment enclosure, auxiliary building, engineered safety features (ESF) building, hydrogen re-combiner building, and the main steam valve building to negative pressure within 120 seconds. Operability of 3HVR*FN13B is required by MPS3 procedures in recognition of the potential for higher (more adverse) ambient temperatures in the area of the charging and RPCCW pumps if the exhaust fan is lost, and also as the suction air source for the ABFS. However, the fan is not included as a TS or Technical Requirements Manual (TRM) required component. Adequate heat removal has been demonstrated with an Ultimate Heat Sink temperature up to 80 Ã‚Â°F (TS 3/4.7.5). During the period 3HVR*FN13B was inoperable, the service water temperature was approximately 41.8 Ã‚Â°F and outside air temperatures (winter air temperatures) ensure delivered air is on the lower side of the allowed range. These service water and outside air temperatures provided substantial margin for ensuring pump cooling capacity. 3HVR*FN13A was in service providing the necessary ventilation for normal operation and as the initial condition for accident scenarios. For 3HVR*FN13B being out of service to have had an adverse effect on an analyzed transient, an event initiator would need to be combined with a failure specifically in the 'A' train (either 3HVR*FN13A, 'A' train Emergency Diesel Generator or 4160 Volt Power Supply). Margin in the current FSAR dose consequence analyses to the 10 CFR 50.67 Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) Limits is shown in the table below. This margin is available to offset the potential fora reduction in the SLCRS drawdown capability following a potential loss of both trains of ABFS. However, all forced flow releases would remain filtered by the SLCRS. During the time spent in the TSAS, including the period of enforcement discretion, the opposite train of ABFS was maintained in service. Therefore, safety margins were maintained.

Millstone Power Station Unit 3 423 2022 001 00 NARRATIVE The System Operating Procedure for Auxiliary Building Emergency Ventilation and Exhaust (OP 3314J) provides instruction for the installation and operation of Portable Emergency Ventilation Fan, 3HVR-FN18, and a portable generator. Performance of this procedure satisfies requirements of TRM 7.4.1, Fire Related Safe Shutdown Components. This procedure is the contingency plan in the event of failure of the charging and RPCCW pump area ventilation system. Providing emergency ventilation to the Auxiliary Building in accordance with OP 3314J is modeled as a recovery action given failure of the Charging/RPCCW area ventilation system in the quantitative risk assessment. The ECCS and RPCCW systems were expected to maintain their ability to perform their safety functions during the period of enforcement discretion. No other structures, systems, or components (SSCs) were affected during the period of enforcement discretion and no limits were imposed on any SSC that hindered their ability to perform their specified function. The independence of the physical barriers to radiological releases were not degraded during the period of enforcement discretion. The planned activities on 3HVR*FN13B did not impact fuel cladding, RCS or Containment integrity. No other SSCs were affected by the proposed period of enforcement discretion, and therefore no limits were imposed on any SSC in performing their specified safety function. Based on the above, there were no safety consequences associated with 3HVR*FN13B being inoperable for a period of approximately 33.5 hours beyond the TS AOT. 4. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The damaged motor was replaced with a spare motor from the warehouse. A like-for-like fan hub and blade assembly was used to replace the damaged hub and blade assembly. Additional corrective actions will be taken in accordance with the station Corrective Action Program. 5. PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES There have been no similar events of a fan being inoperable for longer than the TS AOT at Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in the past three years. 6.

,Unknown Unit,Gas Void in the Emergency Core Cooling System Resulted In a Condition Prohibited By Technical Specifications.,10/6/2022,"On October 6, 2022 at 1300 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, ultrasonic testing (UT) measurements on the ?Å“A??train residual heat removal (RHR) piping identified a gas void greater than acceptance criteria. The most likely source of gas voids in this section of pipe was determined to be inadequate guidance in the operating procedures used to perform filling and venting activities during system restorations following the refueling outage in May 2022. The entire length of piping was vented and UT measurements at multiple locations verified that the voids were reduced to within acceptable limits. This condition is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications.","On October 6, 2022 at 1300 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, ultrasonic testing (UT) measurement on ?Å“A??train residual heat removal (RHR) piping identified a gas void greater than the acceptance criteria. The UT measurement was taken during monthly performance of SP 3610A.3, ?Å“RHR System Vent and Valve  Lineup Verification??on the ?Å“A??low pressure safety injection to charging pump suction line, 3-SIL-008-14-2, at Point 10. The ?Å“A??train of RHR was declared inoperable and Technical Specifications (TS) 3.5.2, Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) was entered. Venting was performed and the ECCS system was declared operable in accordance with SP 3610A.3 on October 6, 2022 at 1725 hours and TS 3.5.2 was exited. On October 14, 2022, SP3610A.3 was performed at point 10 and a gas void greater than acceptance criteria was observed in the line 3-SIL-008-14-2. ?Å“A??train of RHR was declared inoperable, and TS 3.5.2 was entered on October 14, 2022, at 1005 hours. Point 10 was vented and a UT was performed and confirmed that the piping was 100% full of water. TS 3.5.2 was exited on October 14, 2022, at 1737 hours. Troubleshooting was performed on October 15, 2022 to fully characterize the gas void in line 3-SIL-008-14-2. To support this troubleshooting, TS 3.5.2 was entered and ?Å“A??train of RHR was declared inoperable on October 15, 2022 at 0944 hours. This line was divided into 10 sections and full expanded ultrasonic testing measurements were taken at each section. Repeated venting and agitation of the line was performed to remove the gas voids. After the initial expanded UT characterization, it was concluded that the remaining gas void volume was greater than the acceptable gas void volume. After repeated venting and agitation evolutions, the final UT characterization determined that the gas void volume was less than acceptable limits. An operability determination evaluated the  as-left condition and determined that ?Å“A??train of RHR was able to perform its design function. The ECCS system was declared operable and TS 3.5.2 was exited on October 17, 2022 at 1441 hours. On August 31, 2023, an NRC inspector identified a non-conservative error within the void volume calculation 14-ENG-04518M3 ?Å“MP3 GL2008-01 Pump Suction Side Gas Void Allowable Volume Using Westinghouse Simplified Equation Method??approved in 2015. Millstone engineering determined that the pressure used for evaluating a void volume in line 3-SIL-008-014-2 was incorrect and non-conservative. This error resulted in the reduction of the allowable void size acceptance criteria. Based on the corrected acceptable void volume, the original as-found gas void volume identified on October 6, 2022, was greater than the allowable acceptable gas void volume; therefore, the plant was operating in a condition outside of plant Technical Specifications. Void volume greater than acceptable limits existed from May 18, 2022, when the plant entered Mode 3, until October 17, 2022 when void volume was verified to be less than acceptable limits. SP 3610A.3 is performed monthly and the line 3-SIL-008-014-2 was verified to be full of water each month from the refueling outage until its performance on October 6, 2022.

A four-hour non-emergency notification was made for the actuation of the Reactor Protection System in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B). An eight-hour non-emergency notification was made for the actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(B). All systems performed as expected with the exception of the condenser air ejector radiation monitor (ARC-RE21). The radiation monitor momentarily spiked to 2.0E-5 uC/cc, which generated the high alarm until 04:48, when the trend lowered to 5.5E-6 uC/cc to clear the high alarm. At 04:49, ARC-RE21 decreased to its pre-trip value of 3.4E-6 uC/cc. Chemistry sampling performed on May 31, 2023, in accordance with primary to secondary leak rate surveillance procedure (SP 3861), gave no indication of steam generator tube leakage. The actuation of the Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). CAUSE The direct cause of the trip was a ground fault on ?Å“B??phase of the MGOB due to a flashover event that happened inside the ?Å“B??breaker pole fiberglass air supply tube. The supply tube receives air from a 500 psi pressure reducing cabinet, which is supplied by a 3700 psi air receiver that is filled from either of two MGOB air compressors. Air leaks in the breaker air system caused increased air compressor run time resulting in undesired moisture and oil accumulation in the air supply tube that led to flashover. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES There were no safety consequences related to this event. As designed, turbine bypass valves prevented challenging the main steam safety valves following the reactor trip. The maximum indicated steam generator pressure was 1082 psig, which was well below the nominal opening pressure of the first main steam safety valves of 1185 psig. As designed, following the trip, main feedwater was isolated and auxiliary feedwater responded to restore steam generator levels. All reactor coolant pumps continued to operate and reactor coolant system cold leg temperatures were maintained greater than 550Ã‚Â°F following the event. Following the reactor trip, the minimum post-trip pressurizer pressure was approximately 1980 psia, which is well above the low pressurizer pressure setpoint of 1892 psia. The minimum pressurizer level was 32% immediately following the reactor trip. There was no indication of steam generator tube leakage which was verified by chemistry sampling performed on May 31, 2023 in accordance with SP 3861. No safety functions were challenged, and plant operation was maintained within the bounds of Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15: Safety Analysis. This event did not challenge the health and safety of the public or the environment.",4232023001R00,4232023001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 11, 2023 at 1252 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, it was identified during technical specification required response time testing that one of three reactor coolant system (RCS) loop 4 narrow range hot leg resistance temperature detector (RTD), 3RCS*TE441C, did  not meet its response time acceptance criteria. Investigation revealed that this condition had existed for the operating cycle. 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into the thermowell due to a loose coupling nut. The RTD was successfully replaced, calibrated, and response time tested. This condition is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423 q 052 2023 003 00 NARRATIVE On October 11, 2023 at 1252 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, it was identified during response time testing in accordance with surveillance SP 3443E42, ""Rakset 4 RCS Narrow Range RTD Time Response"", that the reactor coolant system (RCS) loop 4 narrow range hot leg resistance temperature detector (RTD), 3RCS*TE441C, did not meet its response time acceptance criteria. AOP 3571, ""Abnormal Operating Procedure"", was entered at 1427 hours and the actions of Attachment A, ""RCS Narrow Range Temperature Channel Failure"", were performed. Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 action 6A and TS 3.3.2 action 20 were entered and the associated reactor protection system (RPS) bistables were placed in the trip condition. Required TS actions were completed on October 11, 2023 at 1517 hours. The temperature indicated by 3RCS*TE441C (Computer Point RCS-T441G) was consistent with the other two narrow range hot leg RTDs in loop 4. The trend of 3RCS*TE441C indicated diminished variation compared to other 11 narrow range hot leg temperature computer points beginning in June of 2022. Based on this trend it was determined that the 3RCS*TE441C slow response time had existed for longer than allowed by plant's technical specifications. On October 16 2023 at 1638, in accordance with SP 3442B04, ""Hot Leg RTD Failure Compensation Procedure"", 3RCS*TE441C was removed from the circuit and in its place, a biased average of the other two RTDs was inserted. The remaining two hot leg RTDs plus the biased signal returned the loop to operable, and bistables were restored to service. TS 3.3.1 action 6A and TS 3.3.2 action 20 were exited. During the Millstone Unit 3 refueling outage in October 2023, 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into its thermowell. The RTD was successfully replaced, calibrated, and response time tested in accordance with of surveillance SP 3443E42. Technical Specification 3.3.1 action 6A for Mode 1 and 2 states that with the number of operable channels one less than the total number of channels, during startup and/or power operation, may proceed provided following conditions are satisfied. (a) The inoperable channel is placed in tripped condition within 72 hours and (B) minimum channel operable requirement is met. Technical Specification 3.3.2 action 20 for Mode 1 and 2 states that with the number of operable channels one less than the total number of channels, during startup and/or power operation, may proceed provided following conditions are satisfied. (a) The inoperable channel is placed in tripped condition within 6 hours and (B) minimum channel operable requirement is met. This condition is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's technical specifications. CAUSE 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into the thermowell due to a loose coupling nut. The cause of the coupling nut becoming loose is unknown.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423 2023 052 003 00 NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES The RCS has three thermowells on each of the four reactor coolant system hot leg loops, and each thermowell houses one dual-element resistance temperature detector (RTD). 3RCS*TE441C senses narrow range hot leg temperature in conjunction with 3RCS*TE441A and 3RCS*TE441D. All three hot leg RTDs, along with a single RTD located in the cold leg of the same RCS loop feed into delta T and Tavg circuitry, in this case supplying signals to RAKSET 4. If 3RCS*TE441C is deemed inoperable, the entire Delta T/Tavg protection circuit would be impacted in RAKSET 4 potentially impacting the response of the overpower delta T (OPAT) and overtemperature delta T (OTAT) trip functions. Each of the other 3 RCS loops have identical and independent instrumentation to the other 3 protection channels. A reactor trip is generated when 2 of the 4 independent channels reach a trip condition. Most of the Chapter 15 safety analysis events that credit the action of the OPAT or OTAT trips are symmetric events in which the behavior of each RCS loop is essentially identical to the behavior of the other RCS loops. In these cases, the potentially degraded behavior of the single loop containing 3RCS*TE441C would not affect the timing of a reactor trip. For events that do not have symmetric loop behavior, the main steam line break (MSLB) shows the greatest loop to loop differences in temperature response. The event presented in Chapter 15 of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) is the limiting MSLB event which is initialized from zero power conditions. As part of the sensitivity studies confirming the limiting nature of the zero power case, an analysis was performed to demonstrate that the MSLB initiated from full power conditions was less limiting. This full power analysis examined a spectrum of break sizes, some of which resulted in an OPAT trip to terminate the event. As expected, the OPAT RCS loop with the break reached the trip condition first. However, as this is just a single channel, a reactor trip did not occur. Of the remaining 3 loops, the next two fastest responding reached an OPAT condition within 0.1 seconds of each other. Therefore, assuming a break occurs in the steam line attached to the RCS loop with 3RCS*TE441C invalidating that loops OPAT trip, an OPAT trip would be delayed at most 0.1 seconds until the next two loops were both in a tripped condition. There is more than adequate margin between the hot full power case results and the event acceptance criteria that the zero power case presented in the FSAR would still be limiting. Therefore, the safety functions provided by the temperature inputs to the reactor protection system was maintained despite the single hot leg RTD, 3RCS*TE441C, not meeting its response time acceptance criteria.

,Unknown Unit,Pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valve Failed to Open During Surveillance Testing Resulting In a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications.,10/20/2023,"On October 20, 2023 at 0240 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 at 0 percent reactor power in Mode 4, with RCS pressure of 342 psia and cold leg temperature of 285 deg F, the 'B' pressurizer power operated relief valve (PORV), 3RCS*PCV456, failed to stroke open upon demand during performance of surveillance testing. The failed PORV was replaced with a rebuilt PORV, and a new pilot solenoid operated valve (SOV). The direct cause of the 'B' PORV failure to stroke was determined to be a failed Stellite pilot solenoid operated valve. The cause analysis identified the SOV contained Stellite material, which was not in conformance with design. Subsequent leakage through the 'B' PORV throughout the operating cycle damaged the SOV top stem and valve ball assembly and prevented it from stroking during surveillance testing. This leakage was present from August 2022 until October 2023; therefore, it is reasonable that the 'B' PORV was inoperable for a period greater than allowed by Technical Specifications. Therefore, this report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), as an operation or condition that was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. This licensee event report (LER) supplement provides the results of a completed cause analysis.","On October 20, 2023 at 0240 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 (MPS3) at 0 percent reactor power in Mode 4, with RCS pressure of 342 psia and cold leg temperature of 285 deg F, the 'B' pressurizer power operated relief valve (PORV), 3RCS*PCV456, failed to stroke open on demand during performance of surveillance testing per SP 36016.2, ""Train B Pressurizer Steam Space Vent Path and PORV Stroke Time Operability."" The PORV was declared inoperable to support both normal operating pressure overpressure protection function and its cold overpressure protection function in Modes 1-3. During plant cooldown, alternative means were utilized to satisfy the associated cold over pressure protection requirements. The MPS3 Pressurizer (PZR) PORV valve is a Crosby pilot solenoid operated (S/N K72047-00-0006) relief valve that relies on a pilot solenoid operated valve lifting to vent main body valve pressure and provide the necessary differential pressure across the main disc to lift. Extensive troubleshooting and offsite testing validated that the failed 'B' PORV was unable to stroke at both high and low pressure conditions. Further investigation identified the solenoid operated valve associated with the 'B' PORV contained Stellite material that was not in conformance with design. The ball was made of stellite, and upper seat was made of stainless steel. Industry operating experience had previously identified that Stellite internals were susceptible to leakage when exposed to steam. In January, 2001, Westinghouse provided a proposal to modify and refurbish several PORV solenoid operated valves (SOVs) to replace the Stellite ball and stainless steel upper seat with Inconel. In June, 2002, an engineering design change was approved and directed four SOVs to be refurbished by the vendor, Westinghouse, and replace the stellite ball and stainless steel upper seat with a ball and upper seat made of Inconel. In 2002, the engineering design change was implemented, however, the material control processes were insufficient to differentiate between the original (Stellite) and modified SOVs. Specifically, material control processes did not require a new material number to be assigned to the modified SOVs. As a result, the modified SOVs did not have a unique material stock code number to differentiate them from the original valves. Using the same material stock-code prevented the ability to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred material when ordering parts. Also, the affected drawings and bill of materials (BOM) were not updated to reflect the new design of the MPS3 PORV SOVs. In April 2005, MPS3 experienced an inadvertent safety injection actuation event which caused the pressurizer PORVs to cycle more than 40 times. Subsequent to the event, both the pressurizer PORVs were replaced with refurbished valves that had the Inconel ball and upper seat. Leakage testing of the removed 'B' PORV pilot SOV (S/N K72047-00-0006) determined that the valve was leaking. The SOV was removed and placed in MPS3 Fuel Building in a satellite quality assurance storage area as blocked stock. The SOV was never refurbished with the Inconel parts and was not entered back into the supply chain inventory tracking system for disposition. During planning for PORV refurbishment in 2021, station and vendor personnel discussed SOV material, however, the question was not pursued, and verification or replacement of the ball and upper seat material was not included in the purchase order for SOV refurbishment. As a result, the incorrect material was not identified and corrected. At that time, there was not a viable replacement pilot SOV available to be used in support of PORV rebuild, therefore the block stock SOV (S/N K72047-00-0006) from satellite QA storage was sent to Westinghouse to perform further analysis on leak tightness and pressure tests. This SOV was also sent to a test facility that could perform steam testing to validate leak tightness at plant conditions. The pilot SOV passed its functional test and seat leakage test before installing in 3RCS*PCV456 during the 3R21 refueling outage in 2022.",4232023006R02,4232023006R02,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications
Vogtle Electric Generating Plant,Unknown Unit,Unit 1 Train A Safety Injection Pump inoperability causes the unit to operate in a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications,9/16/2021,"On 9/16/2021 at 04:54, the Unit 1 A Safety Injection (SI) pump was started for a surveillance. Bearing temperatures rose unexpectedly, the pump was stopped, and it was declared inoperable. An investigation found a piece of plastic tubing between the gears of the lube oil pump, resulting in oil starvation of two bearings and their subsequent failure. The bearings were replaced, the system was flushed, and the pump was restored to operable status on September 29, 2021. Improper oil sampling on the Unit 1 Alpha train SI pump introduced foreign material (FM) into the pump's oil system. The 1A SI pump would not have been able to perform its required safety function from September 6, 2021 at 1436, until Mode 4 was entered on September 12, 2021 at 0759. Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2 Condition A should have been entered due to one train of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) inoperable. Required Action A.1 has a completion time of 72 hours or in accordance with the Risk Informed Completion Time Program, combined with 18 hours for the unit to be in Mode 4, would give 90 hours of total allowed out of service time. The 137.4 hours that the 1A SI pump would not have been able to perform its required safety function exceeded this, and therefore the plant was operated in a condition prohibited by TS.","A. Event Description On 9/16/2021 at 04:54, with plant operating conditions before the event consisting of Unit 1 in Mode 6, at 0 percent power, and approximately 103 degrees Fahrenheit, the Unit 1 A Safety Injection (SI) [BO] pump was started to complete a surveillance. After the pump start, bearing temperatures rose rapidly, the pump was stopped, and was declared inoperable. Subsequent investigation determined that improper oil sampling on the Unit 1 Alpha train SI pump introduced foreign material (FM) into the pump's oil system. The foreign material introduction was not recognized at the time of the samples. The safety injection pump subsequently failed to operate due to low oil flow conditions resulting in bearing failure. The lube oil pump was found with a piece of plastic tubing between the gears of the pump resulting in the pump seizing. Timeline of Unit 1 events: ??9/6/2021 1436- SI pump A was last run during an in-service test (1ST) with no signs of degradation. Additionally, an oil sample was taken during this run. ??9/12/2021 0500- Unit enters Mode 3 for the start of planned outage. ??9/12/2021 0759- Unit enters Mode 4. and TS 3.5.2 no longer applied. ??9/16/2021 0454- SI pump A failed while the unit was in Mode 6. ??9/29/2021- SI pump A returned to operable status. Unit was in Mode 6. and TS 3.5.2 was not applicable. The Safety Injection pump would not have been able to perform its required safety function from September 6, 2021 at 1436 when the pump was last run with no signs of degradation. until the mode of applicability for this pump was exited on September 12, 2021 at 0759 due to a planned refueling outage. Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2 Condition A should have been entered because one train of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) was inoperable in Modes 1- 3. TS 3.5.2 Required Action A.1 has a completion time of 72 hours or in accordance with the Risk Informed Completion Time Program. The required action time, combined with the 18 hours for the unit to be in Mode 4, would give 90 hours of total allowed out of service time. The 137.4 hours that the 1A SI pump would not have been able to perform its required safety function exceeded this allowed out of service time, and therefore the plant was operated in a condition prohibited by TS for 47.4 hours. Therefore, this condition is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). There were no structures. components. or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event that contributed to the event. B. Cause of Event The cause of the event was foreign material intrusion into the SI pump oil system. This led the pump outboard bearing to be starved of lubrication which resulted in failure of the bearing when the pump was started. The foreign material intrusion was caused by improperly obtaining the oil samples for this pump. A plastic tube was inserted into the gearbox next to the oil pump shaft. This caused pieces of the plastic tubing to be removed from the end of the tube and left in the tube oil system. Safety Assessment During the time the A-train SI pump was inoperable, the B-train SI pump was available to perform its specified safety function. The operating crew responded correctly to the event. The applicable procedures were properly entered, and documentation met expectations. The event was within the analysis of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15. There was no release of radioactivity. This event did not pose a threat to the health and safety of the public. Therefore, the safety significance of this issue is very low.",4242021001R00,4242021001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications

Seabrook Station,Unknown Unit,Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications Entered due to Service Water Cooling Tower Fan Inoperable,9/17/2021,"On September 17, 2021 at 04:56, with Seabrook Station at 100% power, the Unit 1 Service Water Cooling Tower Fan ""B"" was declared inoperable due to failure of the associated gear box. The Technical Specifications (TS) Allowed Outage Time (AOT) was 7 days for this condition. On September 23, 2021 at 1930 EST, prior to the expiration of the 7-day AOT, the NRC verbally approved NextEra's request for enforcement discretion to allow 5 additional days to process an Emergency License Amendment Request (LAR). The Emergency LAR would have then allowed continued operation to complete final preparations and necessary repairs that would have taken place during a planned refueling outage, which began in early October, 2021. Seabrook Station operation continued at 100% power for the duration that the Service Water Cooling Tower Fan ""B"" was inoperable. Operability was restored on September 26, 2021 at 04:47 following the completion of a 24 hour post maintenance Operability run. The cause of the event was due to a failed fan reduction gearbox due to inadequate lubrication. An April 28, 2021 gearbox oil analyses was the first indication that an elevated particulate count existed. However, the condition that caused the failure was traced back to maintenance performed in January 2021. Immediate corrective actions were to replace the gear box and drive shaft, perform necessary gear alignments, and perform post maintenance testing that demonstrated Operability.","Event Description: In January 2021, after receiving two consecutive cooling tower fan Service Water Cooling Tower Fan ""B"" gearbox oil samples analysis reports indicating low viscosity and elevated particulate count, an oil change on the fan gearbox oil was performed. As part of post maintenance testing from the oil change, the fan was started and was quickly secured due to visible oil coming out of the fan air path. Visual examination of the unit identified that the pressure switch on the side of the gearbox had a cracked housing and was leaking oil. As a result, the pressure switch was replaced. When the fan was restarted, oil leakage from the fan air path was again identified. Troubleshooting efforts included removing the oil system internal spray nozzle and relief valve. The internal spray nozzle was found plugged and was subsequently cleared and the relief valve successfully bench tested. As part of these maintenance activities, the oil system was cleaned and flushed several times. Post maintenance testing revealed no abnormal indications, and the fan was declared Operable on January 10, 2021. An April 28, 2021 gearbox oil analyses was the first indication since the fan maintenance performed in January 2021 that the elevated particulate count had not been resolved, and could potentially cause a similar lube oil blockage condition. On September 17, 2021 at 04:17 Operations started the ""B"" train Service Water Cooling Tower fans in preparations for gearbox lube oil sampling. The control room received Service Water Cooling Tower Fan 'B' Oil Pressure Low Alarm at approximately 04:55. In response to the alarm, Operations secured the 'B' cooling tower fan and an operator was sent to locally walk down the fan. The Operator identified the fan's drive shaft was broken and oil was leaking out of its gearbox [BS,RGR]. The 'B' Train SW Cooling Tower Loop was declared inoperable and the station entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.4, Action B. TS 3.7.4, Action B, states that with one cooling tower service water loop or one cooling tower cell inoperable, return the affected loop or cell to OPERABLE status within 7 days, or be in at least HOT STANDBY within 6 hours and in COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. After the failed gear box (Western Gear Corporation, Model 2593) and drive shaft were replaced, Operability was restored on September 26, 2021 at 04:47 following the completion of a 24 hour post maintenance run. Since the gearbox failure mechanism existed prior to the September 17, 2021 failure, dating back to a gearbox oil analyses that showed a high particulate count with large steel bearing wear, it is concluded that this condition existed for a duration longer than the Technical Specifications action allowed outage time. This event is being reported in accordance with 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), ""Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications."" There were no out of service SSCs that were inoperable and contributed to the initiation or limited the mitigation of the event. Safety Consequences: The Atlantic Ocean serves as the normal Ultimate Heat Sink for Seabrook Station. However, in the unlikely event that the normal supply of cooling water from the Atlantic Ocean is unavailable, the atmosphere serves as the ultimate heat sink using the mechanical draft evaporative cooling tower. The normal ultimate heat sink of the Atlantic Ocean was fully capable of performing its design function. The remaining ""A"" train Service Water Cooling Tower Fan continued to be able to provide it's safety function. There were no actual safety consequences for this event, and no safety system responses occurred.

Seabrook Station,Unknown Unit,Automatic Actuation of Emergency Service Water during Testing due to a Defective Relay,5/2/2023,"On May 2, 2023, during planned Engineered Safety Features Actuation System Testing, a Tower Actuation (TA) signal occurred. The TA occurred due to the failure of the first level undervoltage load shedding scheme to shed loads from the 4KV bus prior to the Service Water (SW) Ocean Pumps coasting down following the opening of the 4KV supply breaker. With no power to the bus, and the SW Ocean Pumps breakers still closed, a low SW pump discharge pressure condition occurred, resulting in the TA logic being satisfied. Troubleshooting determined that a defective relay contact in the first level undervoltage load shedding scheme caused the failure. The relay was replaced, and the system was returned to service. There was minimal impact to the station due the unplanned actuation, therefore this event had no impact on the health and safety of the public. In addition, there were no other Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that contributed to this event. This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for actuation of the emergency service water system that does not normally run that serves as the ultimate heat sink.","Description On May 2, 2023, the plant was in Mode 5 at 0 percent power with coolant temperature less than 200 degress fahrenheit and depressurized, during planned Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) [ENS: JE] testing, a Tower Actuation (TA) signal occurred. A TA signal is initiated to transfer Service Water (SW) (EIIS: BI) from the ocean when one of two ocean pumps [EIIS: P] is running (in a train) with pump discharge pressure below the low pressure TA setpoint. The TA signal is time delayed by 3 seconds to prevent spurious operation. During the planned ESFAS testing, the combination of a loss of offsite power to the 4 KV bus [EIIS: BU], and Safety Injection (SI) is simulated by simultaneous removal of the safeguards bus protection relay fuses [EIIS: FU], with the actuation of a Si signal. Removal of the bus protection fuses de-energizes both the first and second level undervoltage relay schemes, which also inputs to the Emergency Power Sequencer (EPS). The EPS opens the offsite power source breaker [EIIS: BKR] to the 4 KV bus. The undervoltage schemes shed the loads from the bus. Troubleshooting determined that the load shedding did not occur at the expected time delay (1.2 seconds) associated with the first level undervoltage protection. Instead load shedding occurred at 6 seconds after the test initiation. Six seconds is the time delay associated with load shedding on a second level undervoltage relay actuation coincident with a SI signal present. The Ocean SW pumps remained connected to the 4KV bus for 6 seconds following initiation of the test. With the offsite power supply removed, the pumps coasted down resulting in discharge pressure continuing to decrease to the tower actuation setpoint prior to 6 seconds. The Tower actuation occurred due to the failure of the first level undervoltage load shedding scheme to shed loads from the 4KV bus prior to the SW Ocean Pumps coasting down following the opening of the 4KV Bus supply breaker. With no power to the bus, and the SW Ocean Pump breakers still closed, combined with the subsequent low SW pump discharge pressure, the Tower Actuation logic was satisfied. Troubleshooting determined that a defective relay contact in the first level undervoltage load shedding scheme caused the failure. The relay was replaced, and the system was returned to service. Cause of the Event Complex troubleshooting was performed in accordance with station processes. As part of the troubleshooting, the cause of this event was determined to be a failure of a relay contact in the load shedding circuit. The relay was made by Westinghouse and is a time delay starting relay. Analysis of the Event This licensee event report is being reported pursuant of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) for actuation of emergency service water system that does not normally run and that serves as ultimate heat sinks. This event did not result in a Safety System Functional Failure. Safety Significance There were no safety consequences due to this event. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public.

,Unknown Unit,Auxiliary Feedwater System Inoperable,11/7/2023,"On November 07, 2023, during normal operation, Seabrook Station declared the Auxiliary Feedwater System inoperable because control power to the 'B' train Emergency Feedwater (EFW) flow control valve, which supplies the 'D' Steam Generator (SG), was lost. The 'B' transformer providing control power to the EFW circuit was identified as the failure mechanism. Failure of any of the eight EFW flow control valves to meet its Surveillance Requirements will render all EFW pumps inoperable per Technical Specifications. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) as any event or condition that at the time of discovery could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to remove residual heat.","Description: On November 07, 2023 at 1200 EST, with Unit 1 in MODE 1 at 100 percent power, it was discovered that the red open lights for the 'B' train Emergency Feedwater (EFW) flow control valve [BA, FCV] 1-FW-FV-4244B were not illuminated on the Main Control Board (MCB) or on the Remote Shutdown System (RSS) panel. Loss of control power to the flow control valve represents a failure to meet Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.7.1.2.1.c, which required declaring the Emergency Feedwater Pumps [BA, P] inoperable. Consequently, this event was reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function needed to remove residual heat. Cause of the Event: The loss of control power to the flow control valve was a result of a failed transformer in the motor control center. Without control power, the automatic high-flow isolation design function was challenged. In the supply line to the ??D??Steam Generator (SG), two flow control valves are arranged in series, each powered from separate 120V sources. Train ??B??control power was lost but train ??A??control power remained available. Train 'A' control power preserved the EFW system's capability to supply all of the SGs or to isolate a supply line. Upon transformer and fuse replacement, the EFW system was declared operable. Analysis of the Event: The EFW system is comprised of two 100% capacity pumps (one motor-driven and one turbine-driven). Both pumps discharge to a common header which feeds four branch lines to the SGs. Each branch line includes a manual gate isolation valve, two motor-operated flow control valves, a flow venturi and a flow orifice. The flow control valves are normally open while in operation and closed in the event of a pipe break. Each branch line has two flow control valves in series and they are powered from separate trains. Each of these valves are also provided with a handwheel to allow for manual operation. The EFW system has sufficient redundancy to maintain its safety-related functions under all credible accident conditions. Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.7.1.2.1.c. to verify that each automatic valve in the flow path actuates to its correct position upon receipt of an EFS actuation test signal, was not met. The TS rendered the EFW system inoperable but redundancy allowed for the system to retain its safety functions. Safety Significance: This event was of very low safety significance because the flow control valves are arranged in series, with separate control power sources, assuring that the system's safety functions would have been met. There were no adverse effects to the health and safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, or radiological safety. The station remained in steady- state power operation. Corrective Actions: The failed transformer was replaced.",4432023005R00,4432023005R00,50.73.(a)(2)(v)(B),Safety Function Impairment,Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: Remove residual heat
Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant,Unknown Unit,Reactor Trip Due To Turbine Trip Greater Than 50% Power,9/5/2022,"On September 05, 2022, Unit 1 was operating at approximately 100% power. At 2345, a spurious failure of the channel 1 shaft displacement signal coupled with a previous failure of the channel 2 shaft displacement signal caused a trip of the Unit 1 turbine through the turbine trip logic. This led to a Unit 1 reactor trip due to a turbine trip with reactor power greater than 50%. Entry into the Emergency Plan was not required. The cause of this event was the spurious, momentary failure of the channel 1 main turbine shaft displacement signal coupled with the complete failure of the channel 2 main turbine shaft displacement signal. These excessive displacement signals satisfied the shaft displacement trip logic for the turbine. The cause of the signal failures was determined to be inadequate protection of the shaft displacement probe cabling against chafing. Corrective actions include replacement of all three channels of shaft probes, cables, and drivers, as well as defeating the shaft displacement trip through the next refueling outage. Additional corrective actions included revising the shaft displacement probe installation instructions and developing permanent modifications for the routing of the turbine shaft displacement probes for implementation during the next refueling outage. All times are in Central Daylight Time (CDT).","I. DESCRIPTION OF REPORTABLE EVENT On September 05, 2022, Unit 1 was operating at approximately 100% power. At 2345, a failure occurred of the cabling for the Unit 1 Main Turbine shaft displacement probe channel 1 coupled with a previous failure of the channel 2 shaft displacement probe, resulted in a shaft displacement signal that satisfied the trip logic for the shaft displacement automatic trip of the Unit 1 Main Turbine and Reactor. The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically started as expected. A REPORTABLE EVENT CLASSIFICATION The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), ""Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section."" The Reactor Protection System (RPS) automatically actuated and the AFW started as designed due to low-low steam generator water level following trip. B.

STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT There were no structures, systems, or components which were inoperable prior to the event which contributed to the event. Prior to the main turbine trip, the main turbine and generator were performing their design functions. D. NARATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIMES On September 05, 2022, Unit 1 was operating at approximately 100% power. At 2345 a failure occurred on the Unit 1 Main Turbine shaft displacement probe channel 1 [EIIS:(TA)(DET)(CHA)(CBL)] coupled with a previous failure of the channel 2 shaft displacement probe, resulted in a shaft displacement automatic trip of the Unit 1 Main Turbine. Because reactor power at the time of the turbine trip was approximately 100% power, the Westinghouse permissive P-9 signal was unblocked (power> 50%) as designed and when the turbine tripped an automatic reactor trip was actuated. Reactor operators in the control room responded to the trip in accordance with Emergency Operating procedures. Entry into the Emergency Plan was not required. Operators responded to the event and safely placed Unit 1 in Mode 3 .

Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant,Unknown Unit,Automatic Reactor Trip Due to Lo-LoSteam Generator Level,6/16/2023,"On June 16, 2023, unit 1 was operating at 100% power. At 18:22, the 1B Main Feedwater Pump (MFP) began indicating oscillating speed. The oscillations increased in severity and became unresponsive to manual control input. Due to the loss of control, the 1B MFP was manually tripped as it approached the overspeed setpoints. Following the manual trip of the 1B MFP the Unit responded with an automatic runback to 700MWe. Following the runback, the combined effects of the entire transient resulted in an automatic reactor trip due to Steam Generator #4 Lo-Lo water level. The direct cause of this event was a degraded servo on the 1B MFP. Vendor analysis of the component did not identify a specific failure mechanism and the cause is inconclusive. Based on engineering evaluation, the most probable cause is particulate accumulation in the servo valve due to historical water intrusion events into the 1B lube oil system. An additional supplement will be submitted if further analysis has more conclusive results. Corrective action included replacement of the servo. This LER is a supplement to the original LER 23-001-00 submitted on 8/15/2023. All times are in Central Daylight Time (CDT).","I. DESCRIPTION OF REPORTABLE EVENT A.

The systems that actuated were the Unit 1 Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the Unit 1 Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW). B. PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENT At 18:22 on June 16, 2023, Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant (CPNPP) Unit 1 was in MODE 1 operating at 100% power. C. STATUS OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, OR COMPONENTS THAT WERE INOPERABLE AT THE START OF THE EVENT AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable prior to the event which contributed to the event. D. NARATIVE SUMMARY OF THE EVENT, INCLUDING DATES AND APPROXIMATE TIME On 6/16/2023 at 18:22 the Balance of Plant Operator identified the 1B Main Feedwater Pump (MFP) began indicating oscillating speed. The MFPs were taken to manual control mode to stop or minimize the speed oscillations. Due to the failure of the 1B Servo, the oscillations were not reduced, and the speed control was taken back to Automatic. As a result of the 1B MFP oscillations, the Steam Generator levels fell -5%, then operations tripped the 1B MFP, at 18:30. The Unit responded with an automatic runback to 700MWe. Following the 1B trip, the 1A MFP continued to increase speed to follow the feedwater reference signal and was able to stabilize steam generator level for a period of time prior to the steam pressure dropping due to the steam dumps opening. The 1A MFP was able to increase the Feedwater flow to the Steam Generators and stabilize the Steam Generator (SG) water levels. SG 1-01 and SG 1-03 stabilized around 50% while SG 1-02 and 1-04 showed signs of stabilizing just under 40% as FW Flow and 1A MFP speed increased. Due to the decrease in steam pressure and the SG water levels when 1B was tripped (62% vs 67%), the 1A MFP was not able to pick up enough load to recover from the low Steam Generator Water Level before the SG 1-04 Water Level LO-LO (38%) trip set point was reached and the reactor automatically tripped at 18:32.

Byron Station,1,Pressurizer Safety Valves As-Found Lift Pressure Outside of Tech Spec Limit,9/19/2021,"A pressurizer safety valve (PSV) was removed and tested during the Unit 1 fall 2021 refueling outage (B1 R24) under the Inservice Testing (1ST) program. The as-found lift setting was outside the Technical Specifications (TS) 3.4.10 and 1ST program limits. This required the removal and testing of the remaining two PSVs. The remaining two PSVs were also outside the TS and 1ST program limits. The three PSVs were replaced during the outage. An engineering analysis on the effects of these valves lifting at the as- found settings concluded that all acceptance criteria in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 15 analyses are still met.  This condition of multiple pressurizer safety valves being outside of their required lift setting tolerance band is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(b),  Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications...""","A.

The PSVs were not installed in the system when the condition was discovered. B. Description of Event: Energy Industry Identification System (El IS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10, ""Pressurizer Safety Valves"" requires three pressurizer [PZR] safety valves (PSV)(RY) to be operable with lift settings greater than or equal to 2411 psig and less than or equal to 2509 psig. This lift setting span is based on +/- 2 percent tolerance requirement of a nominal 2460 psig setpoint. TS Surveillance Requirement 3.4.10.1 requires each pressurizer safety valve (PSV) to be lift tested in accordance with the Inservice Testing (IST) program. In accordance with the IST Code, expanding the scope of testing is required for two additional PSVs if a PSV as-found lift pressure exceeds +1- 3 percent of 2460 psig. The 1ST program requires one PSV to be tested each refueling outage, and it requires the remaining two PSVs to be removed and tested if the first PSV's as-found lift pressure exceeds the 1ST scope expansion criteria. Byron Station methodology for testing is to remove the PSV and replace it with an operable PSV and then send the removed PSV to an offsite testing vendor. As part of the fall 2021 Unit 1 refueling outage (B1R24) activities, pressurizer safety valve 1RY8010B was removed and sent to the vendor for testing as required by the IST program. The surveillance as-found acceptance criteria for PSVs are +/- 1.8 percent of 2460 psig. This is a +/- 2 percent tolerance with an additional restriction of 0.2 percent due to vendor instrumentation uncertainty. On September 19, 2021, the vendor testing facility informed Byron Station that the 1RY8010B PSV (S/N: N56964- 00-0094) failed the as-found lift pressure test. The as-found lift pressure was 2385 psig, which is outside the allowed Technical Specification (TS) and Inservice Testing (IST) program limits. In accordance with the 1ST program, the remaining two installed Unit 1 PSVs were removed and sent to the vendor for testing. On September 28, 2021, Byron was informed that the 1RY8010A PSV (S/N: N56964-00-0030) failed the as-found lift pressure test. The as-found lift pressure was 2342 psig, which is outside the allowed TS and 1ST program limits. On October 1, 2021, Byron was informed that the 1RY8010C PSV (S/N: N56964-00-0090) failed the as-found lift pressure test. The as-found lift pressure was 2544 psig, which is outside the allowed TS and 1ST program limits. As the removed valves were replaced with operable valves, no TS action condition applied at the time.

Description of Event: On July 12. 2022. at 03:24 CDT. the OB Control Room (VC)[VI] supply fan (OVCO1CB) failed to start when commanded due to an erroneous position indication from the closed limit switch (OZS-FP432B-A) for the OB VC recirculation charcoal deluge valve (0FP432B). The deluge valve was in the closed position: however. the limit switch operating lever had rolled under the limit switch finger, resulting in the operating lever being in the same position as if the deluge valve was in the intermediate or open position. In accordance with the OB VC Supply Fan control logic drawing (6E-0-4030VCO2). if the 0FP432B valve limit switch is in the intermediate or open position (i.e.. not closed). the supply fan shunt trip coil is energized. preventing the supply fan breaker from remaining closed after a start command. causing the fan to trip immediately.

C. Cause of Event The cause of the event was an Instrument Maintenance First Line Supervisor (IM FLS) used the incorrect process to update the work instructions for installation of the jumpers. The IM FLS changed the installation instructions and did not change the restoration instructions of the work order. After completion of the bus outage, a second IM FLS did not review the jumper installation steps when an IM technician questioned the Equipment Plant Nomenclature (EPN) listed in the restoration instructions of the work order. EPNs listed in the work order (WO) were not correct due to a typographical error and did not match the plant radiation monitors where jumpers had previously been installed. The second IM FLS incorrectly assumed that jumpers were not installed and N/A'd the removal steps. This resulted in the jumpers remaining installed on OPR31J and OPR32J. Inadequate use of Technical Human Performance (THU) tools and Questioning Attitude by both IM FLS's resulted in these errors. D.

Description of Event: At 08:53 on April 23, 2022, during the Byron Station, Unit 2, spring 2022 (B2R23) refueling outage, volumetric examinations of the Reactor Vessel Head Core Exit Thermocouple (CETC) Penetration P-75 identified a recordable indication that did not meet the applicable acceptance criteria. No additional indications were found, and the extent of condition was limited to Penetration 75. During the prior Byron Station B2R19 and B2R20 refueling outages in spring 2016 and fall 2017, the Reactor Pressure Vessel Head Penetration Nozzles were mitigated from Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) using the Ultra-High Pressure Cavitation Peening (UHPCP) process in accordance with the requirements of MRP-335, Revision 3-A. In response to a relief request submitted on August 30, 2018 (ADAMS Accession No. ML18248A060), requesting approval for alternative follow-up inspections of peening-applied reactor vessel head penetration nozzles in accordance with ASME Code Case N-729-4 for the fourth inservice inspection (ISI) interval of Byron Station, Unit 2, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) authorized the proposed alternative on September 19, 2017 (ADAMS Accession No. ML19035A294). 10 CFR 50.55a, ""Codes and standards,"" paragraph (g)(6)(ii)(D) has since been updated such that holders of operating licenses or combined licenses for pressurized- water reactor as of or after June 3, 2020, shall implement the requirements of ASME BPV Code Case N-729-6 instead of ASME BPV Code Case N-729-4, subject to the listed conditions, by no later than one year after June 3, 2020. The indication at P-75 was found outside the required peening coverage area. Peening had not been performed on this area due to geometry limitations where the funnel fillet welds, and the adjacent areas are shadowed by top of the funnel. This indication is located at 184 degrees with a length of 0.197"" with a depth of 0.141"" from the outer diameter (OD) surface of the CETC penetration. The indication extends from 1.498"" to 1.695"" from the end of the nozzle. The indication is axially oriented and is at the location of one of the funnel fillet welds. The indication is in the CETC penetration nozzle itself and not the weld associated with the anti-rotation weld for the funnel. Although this portion of the nozzle is not part of the pressure retaining boundary, it does fall within the jurisdiction of ASME Section XI and is Class 1 safety related.

Wolf Creek Generating Station,Unknown Unit,Automatic Reactor Trip Due to Low Steam Generator Level,5/12/2021,"On 5/12/2021, Wolf Creek Generating Station was performing initial reactor startup following Refueling Outage 24 (RF24). With reactor power at approximately 8%, steam generator levels began to oscillate while in automatic control. Operators took manual control of the main feedwater regulating bypass valves but were unable to stabilize steam generator levels prior to reaching the ?Å“C??steam generator low level reactor trip setpoint. At 1125 Central Daylight Time (CDT), the reactor tripped and an auxiliary feedwater actuation occurred. All equipment responded as expected. ENS notification #55252 was made at 1441 CDT in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for a specified system actuation. The cause of the event was determined to be during the 7300 modification, improper utilization of main feedwater regulating bypass valves inherent valve curves did not take into consideration system flow characteristics. The result was an inaccurate correlation of feed flow with valve position within the system. This led to a mismatch in feed flow demand and actual feed flow to the steam generators. Due to improper gain settings, the mismatch began to diverge and led to a reactor trip on low steam generator water level. Following tuning of control parameters, operators were able to commence reactor startup and reached full power on 5/15/2021.","PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENTS The plant was at Mode 1 returning to service following Refueling Outage 24 (RF24) and was at approximately 8% power when the reactor tripped. No systems, structures, or components (SSCs) were inoperable at the beginning of the event which contributed to the event. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S) Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes and component codes are identified in the text as [XX]. During Refueling Outage 24 (RF24), the feedwater control system [JB] was upgraded. The newly upgraded system is a digital based Emerson Ovation System. This system operates in two modes: low-power and high-power. The transition between the two is based on the measured loop feedwater flow exceeding a predefined threshold. Both control modes operate the main feed regulating valves (MFRVs) and the MFRV bypass valves [SJ-V], as appropriate. The transition between the low-power and high-power modes of operation is accomplished automatically. The old system required manual actions that would demand operator attention, during start up and shutdown. EVENT DESCRIPTION At 1125 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on May 12, 2021, Wolf Creek??¢s reactor tripped in automatic due to low ??C??steam generator [SB-SG] water level. Prior to the reactor trip, Control Room personnel had brought the plant from ~1 percent to ~8 percent power and had entered Mode 1 following RF24. Operators stabilized power at ~8 percent where they intended to hold for Ovation testing and tuning of the newly installed modification. Although steam generator level control was initially stable in automatic, operators observed steam generator levels begin to oscillate. Initially, narrow range was most observable, but it became evident on wide range level as well. As the oscillations increased and diverged, operators determined they should take manual control of the MFRV bypass valves to stabilize steam generator levels prior to commencement of control system tuning. Simultaneous with operators deciding to take manual control, 7300 project personnel and the Westinghouse Ovation engineer were monitoring trends and had agreed that the MFRV bypass valves should be taken to manual control. Operators placed all four bypass valves in manual; however, operator actions were unable to stabilize steam generator levels before ??C??steam generator level lowered to 23.5 percent, the low-low steam generator level reactor trip and main feedwater isolation set point. This resulted in the reactor tripping in automatic and initiating the Main Feedwater Isolation and Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation.

Wolf Creek Generating Station,Unknown Unit,Low Steam Generator Level due to Main Feedwater Valve Failure Caused Automatic Reactor Trip,8/18/2021,"At 1036 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on 8/18/2021, Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) experienced a reactor trip due to low level in the 'B' steam generator. WCGS was operating in MODE 1 at 100% power when the trip occurred. ENS notification #55416 was made at 1251 CDT in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv) (A) for an auxiliary feedwater system actuation. All control rods dropped, all equipment functioned as designed, and offsite power remained available. The direct cause was a fracture of the valve stem for the 'B' steam generator main feedwater regulating valve, causing the valve to fail closed and resulting in a loss of feed flow control to the ??B??steam generator. The hardware failure anaylsis performed on the valve stem determined that the fracture was due to a fatigue crack which had propagated through the stem of the valve. Tool marks within the thread root, as well as the thread root being cut deeper and narrower were identified as stress risers which allowed the crack to propagate into the material of the stem. Dye penetrant testing of the replacement stem, and on the existing valve stems of the three other main feedwater regulating valves, showed no relevant indications.","PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENTS The plant was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power when the reactor tripped. No systems, structures, or components (SSCs) were inoperable at the beginning of the event which contributed to the event. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S) Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes and component codes are identified in the text as [XX]. The main feedwater regulating valves (MFRVs) [SJ-FCV] are air operated angle valves which automatically control feedwater flow to the steam generators (SGs) [SB-SG] between 30 percent and full power. The MFRVs are located in the turbine building. The MFRVs also can provide backup isolation of main feedwater flow in the event that a main feedwater isolation valve (MFIV) [SJ-ISV] fails to close. Closure of the MFIVs or MFRVs terminates flow to the SGs, in the event of a feedwater line break occurring upstream of the MFIVs or MFRVs. Since the MFIVs are located upstream of the point where the auxiliary feedwater lines connect to the main feedwater lines, which is in turn upstream of the main feedwater check valves (located in Area 5 inside the auxiliary building), closure of the MFIVs or the MFRVs ensures delivery of auxiliary feedwater to the SGs for support of the auxiliary feedwater function in the event of a main feedwater line break in the turbine building. AEFCV0520 is the MFRV on the main feedwater line which feeds the 'B' SG and has a Copes-Vulcan actuator. The actuator valve stem is made from ASTM A276 Type 316 Condition B stainless steel with a 1"" in diameter and 8 UNC-2A threads. EVENT DESCRIPTION Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power on August 18, 2021, when at 1035 Central Daylight Time (CDT), feed water flow began dropping. As a result of the lower flow, valve demand increased which caused the valve position indication to increase. The balance-of-plant (BOP) operator reported that going to manual would not change the course of the transient as the signal was responding properly to actual level decrease. The BOP operator was then directed to trip the plant based on loss of flow indication. But prior to taking action, SG 'B' level fell below the low SG level reactor trip and main feedwater isolation set point of 23.5 percent and at 1036 CDT, the reactor automatically tripped. This resulted in a Main Feedwater Isolation and an Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation. All control rods dropped, all required safety systems functioned as designed, and offsite power remained available.

Wolf Creek Generating Station,Unknown Unit,Low Steam Generator Level due to Main Feedwater Valve Failure Caused Reactor Trip,7/18/2022,"At 1803 Central Daylight Time (CDT) on July 18, 2022, Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) experienced an automatic reactor trip due to low level in the 'B' steam generator. WCGS was operating in MODE 1 at 100% power when the trip occurred. ENS notification #56005 was made at 2017 CDT in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) due to reactor scram, and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for an auxiliary feedwater system actuation. All control rods dropped, all equipment functioned as designed, and offsite power remained available. The direct cause of the event was a failure of the valve stem for the 'B' steam generator (SG) main feedwater regulating valve (MFRV), causing the valve to fail closed and resulting in a loss of feedwater flow control to the 'B' SG. The hardware failure analysis performed on the valve stem determined that the failure of the valve stem was due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) initiating from the external surface within the region contained within the packing area. The root cause investigation found that during the previous valve rebuild, an inappropriate chemical (anti-seize) was applied to the stem for lubrication to assist in the rebuild. It was the presence of this chemical which caused the SSC that led to the failure. All four MFRVs are scheduled to be rebuilt during the upcoming refueling outage in October 2022 with all four valve stems then being sent off to be examined to look for evidence of SCC.","PLANT CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENTS The plant was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power when the reactor tripped.

EVENT DESCRIPTION Wolf Creek Generating Station (WCGS) was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power on July 18, 2022, when at 18:02:55 Central Daylight Time (CDT), ??B??SG feed flow dropped from 3.85M lbm/hr to 690K lbm/hr. This caused an alarm in the Control Room for ??B??SG Flow Mismatch. The Ovation feedwater control system responded by taking the ??B??MFRV demand and positioning to 100% open as well as increasing main feedwater pump speed, though flow through the ??B??SG did not respond. The Control Room Operators identified the issue and were in progress of tripping the reactor based on these conditions; however, at 18:03:22 (27 seconds after first alarm), the reactor tripped automatically due to Low Level on the ??B??SG (23.5% on 2/4 level instruments).

Callaway Plant.,1,Manual Actuation of Essential Service Water System,2/9/2021,"On February 9, 2021, at 0838 operators commenced placing both trains of Essential Service Water (ESW) in manual alignments in accordance with annunciator response procedure OTA-RK-00014, Addendum 12A, ""Service Water Pump Lockout."" The manual actuation of ESW was in response to a condition where two non-safety Service Water (SW) pumps tripped and locked out due to low lubrication (lube) water pressure. The cause of the trips and subsequent lockouts of the 'A' and 'B' SW pumps was attributed to low lube water pressure caused by fouling of the lube water Y-strainers. The fouling occurred since the normal weekly backflush of the Y-strainers could not be performed while a temporary alteration in support of maintenance (TASM) was installed in order to repair a leak in the permanent lube water piping. Preventive Maintenance (PM) tasks had not been initiated prior to the event to periodically clean the Y-strainers in order to compensate for the inability to backflush. The initial corrective action taken in response to the event was cleaning of the Y-strainers in the lube water piping.  In addition, PM tasks were created to clean the Y-strainers on a weekly basis for the remaining time that the TASM was installed.  The permanent corrective action was to complete a modification to replace the section of the common lube water piping where the leak occurred. Both trains of ESW were returned to standby alignments on February 9, 2021 at 1140.","1.  DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S): The event reported in this LER involves the Essential Service Water (ESW) system [EIIS: BI] and the nonsafety-related Service Water (SW) system [EIIS: KG]. The ESW system provides a safety-related flow of cooling water to transfer residual heat and heat from components to the Ultimate Heat Sink (UHS) [EIIS: BS]. The ESW system also provides a non-preferred safety-related source of makeup for the Spent Fuel Storage Pool [EIIS: DA] and a non-preferred safety-related supply for the Auxiliary Feedwater [EIIS: BA] system. The ESW system consists of two independent and redundant trains. During normal operation, the loads in either or both ESW system trains may be supplied from the nonsafety-related SW system, which is cross-connected to the ESW system trains. In order to prevent loss of UHS inventory and ensure that pressure and flow in the ESW system trains are sufficient to meet the system's required safety functions, upon receipt of a safety injection signal (SIS) [EIIS: JE], loss of offsite power (LOOP) signal, or auxiliary feedwater actuation signal (AFAS) [EIIS: JE] with low suction pressure [EIIS: PT] indication, both ESW system trains are actuated and safety-related isolation valves [EllS: ISV] isolate nonsafety-related loads and the SW system from ESW system trains. Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.8, ""Essential Service Water System (ESW),"" provides the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO), Required Actions, and Surveillance Requirements (SRs) for the ESW system. During normal plant operation, the SW system supplies cooling water to various main plant auxiliary heat exchange equipment and returns it to the circulating water system return line inside the plant. The SW system also supplies cooling water to the ESW system components during normal operation. The three 50 percent system capacity SW pumps are single-stage, double-suction, vertical, constant-speed dual-volute centrifugal type. Lubrication (lube) water is provided to each SW pump to lubricate the pump bearings. There are mesh basket Y-strainers with 1/32-inch perforations installed in the lube water piping to clean the water prior to it entering the pump bearings. Instrumentation is provided for lube water flow and pressure. The normal range for pressure is 15 to 55 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), and the normal range for flow is 3 to 6 gallons per minute (gpm). In order to protect the SW pump bearings in the case of low lube water flow, there are automatic SW pump trip setpoints of 7 psig for lube water pressure and 1.5 gpm for lube water flow. 2. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: The Callaway plant was in MODE 3 at normal operating temperature and pressure at the lime of this event. No major safety related systems were out of service. 3. EVENT DESCRIPTION: On February 9, 2021. at 0838, operators commenced placing both ESW trains in manual alignments in accordance with annunciator response procedure OTA-RK-00014, Addendum 12A, ""Service Water Pump Lockout."" The manual actuation of ESW was in response to a condition where two non-safety SW pumps tripped and locked out due to low lube water pressure. Prior to the event, on January 13, 2021, a pipe leak was identified on the common header supplying lube water to the SW pumps. In order to isolate the leak, a temporary alteration in support of maintenance (TASM) was installed which supplied lube water to the SW pumps from the 'A' circulating water (CVV) pump [EIIS: KE] lube water supply. A night order was issued along with the TASM, giving instructions to operators that the SW pump lube water Y-strainers should not be backflushed. The TASM altered the configuration of the SW lube water piping such that backflushing could not be performed. Instead of backflushing, the guidance was to initiate a job to clean the lube water Y-strainers if lube water flow and pressure could not be maintained. (Otherwise, backflushing is normally performed on a weekly basis during outside operator rounds.)

Callaway Plant.,1,Reactor Trip During Reactor Trip Breaker Surveillance Testing,1/7/2022,"With the plant at full power on January 7, 2022, an undetected relay failure caused the solid-state reactor protection system (SSPS) to actuate during restoration from a Reactor Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test, thus resulting in an unplanned reactor trip. The reactor trip was reported per Event Notification 55698 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). The cause of the reactor trip was that procedure OSP-SB-0001B, ""Reactor Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test,"" did not include adequate instructions for verifying the absence of a ""B"" train General Warning trip signal prior to operating the ""A"" train Multiplexer Test Switch during test restoration. This was due to inadequate guidance for development of the procedure. Corrective Actions include revising Operations surveillance procedures to include verification of green and amber test lights at panel SB032B during restoration and revising Operations and l&C surveillance procedures to include verification that contacts for relays that have actuated during the test have changed back to their normal state, prior to test restoration. Additional corrective actions include revising the procedure preparation process, improving the screening and incorporation of Operating Experience, improving lesson plans, conducting training, placing operator aids adjacent to the Multiplexer Test Switch, and requiring an inspection on other master relays.","1. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S): The systems and components affected by this event include the reactor protection system (RPS) and the solid-state protection system (SSPS). The RPS at Callaway Plant initiates a unit shutdown, based on the values of selected unit parameters, to protect against violating the core fuel design limits and reactor coolant system pressure boundary design limits during anticipated operational occurrences and to assist the Engineered Safety Features systems in mitigating accidents. 2. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: Callaway was in MODE 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power at the time of this event. No major safety related systems were out of service. 3. EVENT DESCRIPTION: On January 7, 2022 at 1223 with the reactor at approximately 100% rated thermal power, the reactor automatically tripped as a result of a set of contacts internal to SSPS 'B' train Master Relay SB032CK524 that failed to close. Safety systems functioned as expected. The Operations staff responded to the event in accordance with applicable plant procedures. An ENS notification (EN# 55698) was made for this event at 1629 hours on January 7, 2022. Prior to the reactor trip, Operations and Instrumentation and Control (I&C) personnel coordinated the performance of ISF-SB-00A32, ""SSPS Tm B Functional Test,"" and OSP-SB-0001B, ""Reactor Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test,"" to perform regularly scheduled Technical Specification surveillances on the ""B"" Train Solid State Protection System and ""B"" Train Reactor Trip Breaker. All steps in both procedures were performed as written, with MC completing ISF-SB-00A32 as briefed prior to the performance of Section 6.4 of OSP-SB-0001B. With AC testing completed, Operations proceeded with the performance of Section 6.4 for the Trip Breaker 'B' Trip Actuating Device Operational Test (TADOT), which closes Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker ""B"" in order to conduct testing that opens Reactor Trip Breaker ""B"". By design, closing Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker ""B"" creates a General Warning signal which has the potential to trip the reactor if a second General Warning signal is received. After testing was completed and during the restoration of Section 6.4, once Reactor Trip Breaker ""B"" was closed, Reactor Trip Breaker Bypass Breaker ""B"" was opened. In accordance with OSP-SB-0001B, Operations verified that Annunciator 76A, ""SSPS B GENERAL WARNING,"" was clear and that the General Warning red light on panel SB029B for SSPS Train 'B' was off. These indications led Operators to believe that the General Warning signal was no longer present, and consequently, the Operators proceeded on with Step 6.4.45 to return the multiplexer test switch through ""Inhibit"" to the ""A+B"" position at SB029B. Moving the multiplexer test switch through ""Inhibit"" is known to generate a second General Warning signal, but this is required to restore SSPS to the normal configuration. When Operations performed Step 6.4.45 to place the multiplexer test switch through ""Inhibit"" at SB029B, a reactor trip occurred unexpectedly. Per plant design, an auxiliary feedwater system actuation occurred as expected in response to the reactor trip. Also, consistent with plant response to a reactor trip from a high power level, a main feedwater isolation signal was generated. Following the reactor trip, an erratic position indication was observed for one feedwater isolation valve, but the valve was subsequently confirmed to be closed. In addition, one intermediate range nuclear instrumentation channel failed. Other nuclear instrumentation channels functioned correctly to indicate the shutdown state of the reactor. These failures did not complicate the  NRC FORM 3668 (08-2020) Page 2 of 4",4832022001R00,4832022001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
Callaway Plant,1,Containment Spray Recirculation Valve Out of Position Resulted in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications and Condition Which Could Have Prevented Fulfillment of a Safety Function,6/21/2022,"On June 21, 2022 during performance of the B Train Containment Spray (CS) Pump Inservice Test quarterly surveillance, the discharge pressure of the B CS Pump failed to meet its Technical Specification (TS) minimum allowable value. A valve lineup for the B CS train identified that the CS Pump B Recirculation Throttle Valve, ENVOI 27, was locked open instead of its correct position, locked closed. Subsequently, ENVOI 27 was placed in the correct locked-closed position, and the B Train CS Pump Inservice Test quarterly surveillance was re-performed with results meeting the acceptance criteria. Investigation determined that ENV0127 was last positioned on May 11, 2022 during a fill-and-vent operation of the B CS train when the plant was shutdown, after which ENV0127 was not properly restored to a locked-closed position. A review of past operation determined that the condition resulted in the failure to meet TS Limiting Condition of Operation 3.6.6 from May 23, 2022, when the plant entered the mode of applicability at 0601, until ENVOI 27 was restored on June 21, 2022 at 1000. The cause of this error was determined to be a failure of Operations Technicians to appropriately utilize human performance event prevention tools prior to operating ENV0127 during the fill-and-vent restoration activity and ensure ENV0127 was returned to the appropriate configuration. As a corrective action, the Operations staff will receive training on the requirements, expectations, and tools to ensure plant equipment is positioned correctly.","1. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S): The systems and components affected by this event include the B Train of the Containment Spray (CS) System [El IS:BE]. The CS System at Callaway Plant is responsible for providing containment atmosphere cooling to limit post-accident containment pressure and temperature to less than the design values. Additionally, reduction of containment pressure and the iodine removal and retention capability of the spray reduces the release of fission product radioactivity from containment to the environment, in the event of a Design Basis Accident, to within limits. The CS System consists of two separate trains of equal capacity, each capable of meeting the design bases. 2. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: Callaway Plant was in MODE 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power at the time of discovery of this event. No major safety related systems were out of service at the time of discovery of the event, with the exception of the B Train CS System, which was inoperable for the surveillance testing leading to discovery of the event. The condition which led to this event occurred when the plant was in MODE 6, Cold Shutdown. 3. EVENT DESCRIPTION: On June 21, 2022 Operations performed OSP-EN-P001B, 'Train B Containment Spray Pump Inservice Test,"" to run the B Containment Spray Pump for a quarterly surveillance. During the test the discharge pressure of the B CS Pump was identified as 225 psig, which is lower than the Technical Specification (TS) minimum discharge pressure of 250 psig. Operations staff walked down the valve lineup for the B CS train and identified that ENVOI 27, Containment Spray Pump B Recirculation Throttle Valve, was not in the correct position. The normal TS-required position of ENVOI 27 is locked closed, but ENVOI 27 was found locked open. Operations repositioned ENVOI 27 to its correct position and reperformed OSP-EN-P001B, resulting in meeting the acceptance criteria with a discharge pressure of 255 psig. After investigation, it was determined that ENVOI 27 was last positioned during Refueling Outage 25, during a fill-and-vent operation for the B CS train on May 11, 2022. During this operation, restoration steps directed that ENVOI 27 be locked-closed; however, the valve was mistakenly left in a locked-open position. On May 23, 2022 at 0601, the plant entered MODE 4, which is one of the the Modes of applicability for TS Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) 3.6.6, ""Containment Spray and Cooling Systems"" (Modes 1, 2, 3, 4). Callaway Plant remained in a Mode of applicability for TS LCO 3.6.6 from that time on, including when the condition was discovered on June 21, 2022. With respect to opposite Train A of the CS System, the period of operation from May 23 through June 21, 2022 was reviewed for concurrent inoperability of both trains. Train 'A' of the CS System was inoperable for planned surveillance activities on June 1, 2022, from 0346 until 0601 that day. An extent-of-condition review was performed per the Callaway Plant Corrective Action Program under Condition Report (CR) 202204246 as part of the causal investigation for this event to ensure other similar valves were not subject to similar positioning errors. Of the five similar-style valves, i.e., those with 90-degree operators oriented in a similar manner that could lend themselves to possible mispositioning and which are installed in safety related systems, none were identified with a similar mispositioning issue. 4. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES: There were no actual nuclear, radiological, or personnel safety impacts associated with this event. The potential impact was on radiological safety with respect to ensuring that the function of the CS system was met, if a transient had occurred that required the",4832022002R00,4832022002R00,"50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(C), 50.73.(a)(2)(v)(D)",,
Callaway Plant,1,Class 1E Electrical Air Conditioning System Thermal Expansion Valve Failure Resulted in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications,10/25/2022,"At 1530 on 10/25/22, a condition was identified for one of the two Class 1E Electrical Equipment Air Conditioning (Class 1E A/C) trains. Specifically, frost and condensation were observed on the equalizing line for the #1 thermal expansion valve (TXV) associated with the compressor on the ""A"" train's refrigeration unit, SGK05A [EIIS system: VI, component: ACU]. At that time, the unit was considered Operable but degraded. At 0947 on 10/27/22, however, SGK05A was discovered to be tripped due to high discharge temperature. The ""A"" Class 1E A/C train was declared inoperable. Upon further review, it was determined that the condition observed on 10/25/22 was firm evidence of a malfunctioning TXV (#1), which caused inadequate refrigerant flow to the compressor. It was thus determined that SGK05A became inoperable at that time. With one Class 1E A/C train inoperable, Required Action A.1 of TS 3.7.20, ""Class 1E Electrical Equipment Air Conditioning (A/C) System,"" requires immediately taking action to implement mitigating actions. With Required Action A.1 not met, the plant must be in Mode 3 within 6 hours per Required Action B.1. Since SGK05A was not considered to be inoperable on 10/25/22, these Required Actions and Completion Times were not met, thus resulting in a condition prohibited by TS 3.7.20. TXV #1 was replaced, and SGK05A was declared OPERABLE on 10/30/22 at 1420. This LER is a supplement/revision to the original LER submitted 12/21/2022.","1. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S), SYSTEM(S), AND COMPONENT(S): The Class 1E electrical equipment air conditioning (Class 1E A/C) trains provide a suitable environment for the Class 1E electrical equipment trains. The Class 1E A/C system [EIIS system: VI] consists of two independent trains such that each train provides cooling of recirculated air in the rooms normally dedicated to that train. Each train consists of a prefilter, self-contained refrigeration unit (SGK05A/B) [EIIS system: VI, component: AHU] using normal service water or essential service water (ESW) [EIIS system: BI] as a heat sink, centrifugal fans, instrumentation, and controls to provide for electrical equipment room temperature control. The Class 1E A/C trains have emergency operation functions and also operate during normal unit operation. Each train is normally aligned to cool only the equipment associated with its emergency load group. The Class 1E A/C trains are operated in a continuous recirculation mode to maintain the ESF switchgear [EIIS systems: EB, ED, and EJ, component SWGR] rooms, the battery [EIIS system: EJ, component: BTRY] rooms, and the DC switchboard [EIIS system: EJ] rooms to a temperature of less than or equal to 90 degrees F. Additional recirculation capability is provided via the supplemental cooling system, which consists of two trains of standby fans and dampers that may be actuated via operator action. With a Class 1E A/C train inoperable, the additional recirculation capability (either train) may be utilized in conjunction with the remaining Class 1E A/C train to provide adequate area cooling for both trains of Class 1E electrical equipment during normal and accident conditions. Requirements for the Class 1E A/C trains are specified in Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.20, ""Class 1E Electrical Equipment Air Conditioning (A/C) System."" Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.20 specifies that two Class 1E electrical equipment A/C trains shall be Operable during Modes 1, 2, 3 and 4. With one Class 1E electrical equipment A/C train inoperable, Condition A and its three Required Actions under LCO 3.7.20 apply. Required Action A.1 requires immediately initiating action to implement mitigating Actions; Required Action A.2 requires verifying room area temperatures less than or equal to 90 degrees F within 1 hour and once per 4 hours thereafter; Required Action A.3 requires restoring the inoperable Class 1E electrical equipment A/C train to Operable status within 30 days. With the Required Action(s) and Completion Time(s) not met, Condition B and its Required Actions under LCO 3.7.20 apply. Specifically, Required Actions B.1 and B.2 require the plant to be in Mode 3 (Hot Shutdown) within 6 hours and in Mode 5 (Cold Shutdown) within 36 hours, respectively. 2. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: Callaway Plant was in MODE 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power at the time of discovery of this event. For the period of time during which it was determined that the affected Class 1E A/C train had been inoperable, the plant remained in Mode 1. No other contributing inoperable SSCs were identified during this event. 3. EVENT DESCRIPTION: On 10/25/22 at 1530, frosting and condensation were observed on the equalizing line from the thermal expansion valve (TXV) #1 for the compressor on the ""A"" Class 1E A/C unit, SGK05A. TXV #1 is the first of four thermal expansion valves (for each A/C unit) that sequentially operate to regulate refrigerant flow to the unit's compressor. The identified frosting and condensation indicated that TXV #1 could be impeding refrigerant flow to the compressor. An Immediate Operability Determination (IOD) was performed, which concluded that SGK05A was Operable but degraded, as the associated ESF switchgear room temperature was still being maintained at approximately 67 degrees (i.e., within its normal day-to-day range), thus providing evidence that the A/C unit was providing adequate cooling at that time.",4832022003R01,4832022003R01,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications
Callaway Plant,1,Inoperable Instrument Tunnel Sump Level Indication Resulted in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications,10/1/2023,"On October 1, 2023, as water was being added to the containment instrument tunnel sump for testing, the level indication failed to promptly respond. From review of this condition, including sump level trend data, it was determined that sump level indication had stopped responding to changes in sump level on March 2, 2023. Therefore, Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.15, ""RCS Leakage Detection Instrumentation,"" was not met from March 2, 2023, to September 30, 2023 (when the mode of applicability was exited). The 30-day completion time of Required Action A.2 (for restoring the inoperable instrument) was thus exceeded during that time. The direct cause of the instrument inoperability is that the stem of the level instrument was not centered in the stilling well pipe. This allowed the float to contact the side of the pipe, making it unable to move freely along the stem. Primary corrective action is to modify the instrument tunnel sump level monitor to include a centering bracket for the float stem and/or remove the stilling well pipe.","1. DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE(S) SYSTEM(S) AND COMPONENT(S): The containment sump level and flow monitoring system [EllS:BD] indicates reactor coolant pressure boundary leakage (i.e., ""unidentified leakage) by monitoring increases in sump level. Primary system leakage would result in reactor coolant flowing into the containment normal sumps and into the instrument tunnel sump. Indication of increasing sump level is transmitted to the control room by means of individual sump level transmitters. This information is used to provide a measurement of leakage by monitoring sump level increase versus time. The containment instrument tunnel sump level indication is summed with level indication from the containment normal sumps to determine a leak rate value for leakage making its way into the containment sumps. The containment sump level monitoring system is required to detect a leak rate of 1 gpm within 1 hour in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.15 and Regulatory Guide 1.45. The sensing element used for leakage detection is a GEMs XM-800 model sensor which is essentially a stainless-steel tube with reed switches actuated by a single magnetic float. The sensor was installed as a plant modification during Refuel 25 in April 2022. The sensor was installed inside an existing stilling well consisting of a 4"" pipe that is open ended about 6"" above the floor of the sump. The stilling well (pipe) has an inside diameter of 4.02"", and the magnetic float of the sensor has a diameter of 1.63"", allowing for 1.19"" of clearance on all sides of the float. This assumes the float is installed such that it is centered top to bottom. However, there is no mechanism for ensuring the tip of the sensor (at the bottom of the stilling well) is centered when it is installed, and the evidence indicates that the float became stuck on the lower edge of the stilling well due to the stem not being centered. Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.15, ""RCS Leakage Detection Instrumentation,"" requires a diverse set of instruments to be available for leak detection. Specifically, it requires the containment sump level and flow monitoring system, one containment atmosphere particulate radioactivity monitor, and the containment cooler condensate monitoring system to be operable in Modes 1 through 4. With the required containment sump level and flow monitoring system inoperable, Condition A and its associated Required Actions under TS 3.4.15 must be entered. Required Action A.2, in particular, requires restoring the containment sump level and flow monitoring system to operable status within the specified Completion Time of 30 days; otherwise, Condition E must be entered. The required Actions for Condition E require a plant shutdown. (Specifically, Required Action E.1 requires the plant to be in Mode 3 (hot shutdown) in 6 hours, and Required Action E.2 requires the plant to be in Mode 5 (cold shutdown) in 36 hours.) TS 3.4.13, ""RCS Operational LEAKAGE,"" requires that RCS Operational Leakage shall be limited to no pressure boundary leakage, 1 gpm unidentified leakage, 10 gpm identified leakage, and 150 gallons per day of primary-to- secondary leakage through any one steam generator. The determination of compliance with this TS depends in part on use of an operable instrument tunnel sump level indicator. 2. INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS: Callaway Plant was in Cold Shutdown for the start of Refuel Outage 26 at the time of discovery of this event. Thus, the plant was outside the mode of applicability of TS 3.4.15 at the time of discovery.",4832023001R00,4832023001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B),Technical Specification Non-Compliance,Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications
South Texas Project,1,Frozen Common Sensing Line Results in Loss of Two Main Feedwater Pumps Leading to Automatic Reactor Protection and Auxiliary Feedwater Systems Actuations due to Low Steam Generator Level.,2/15/2021,"On February 14, 2021, at 1516 hours the South Texas Project Electrc Generating Station entered a period of abnormally cold weather. The temperatures on site reached 16 degrees Fahrenheit at the time of the event. A section of exposed common sensing line that fed pump protection switches for the Unit 1 steam generator feedwater pumps (SGFP) was not insulated or heat traced. The common line froze resulting in two out of three SGFPs tripping off-line. The Unit 1 reactor tripped on low steam generator level two minutes later. The startup feedwater pump tripped a short time afterwards from the same cause. An organizational and programmatic root cause evaluation identified that station personnel implemented a freezing weather plan that was fragmented and lacked engagement, sufficient direction, verification of readiness, and designated ownership to ensure the station was prepared for abnormally cold weather. This event is reportable as an event that resulted in the automatic actuation of the Unit 1 reactor protection system and auxiliary feedwater system. Planned corrective actions include streamlining and revision of the freeze protection program and installing additional insulation and heat trace. The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates and there were no personnel injuries or damage to any safety-related equipment associated with this event. Additionally, all Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) equipment operated as designed. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.","Description of Reportable Event A. Reportable event classification This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in the automatic actuation of reactor protection system (RPS) (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(1)), and Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) (BA) (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(6)). B. Plant operating conditions prior to event Prior to the event both Unit 1 and Unit 2 were at full power in Mode 1. C. Status of structures, systems, and components that were INOPERABLE at the start of the event and that contributed to the event No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event. D. Background information The feedwater system (SJ) is composed of three nominal 40-percent-capacity (normally operating at 33-1/3-percent- capacity), turbine-driven, single-stage feedwater pumps (P) connected in parallel to supply feedwater to the four steam generators (SG). During normal operation all the pumps are running to supply the required flow of feedwater to the four steam generators. In addition to the three turbine-driven (main) steam generator feedwater pumps (SGFPs), one motor- driven startup steam generator feedwater pump (SUFP) (P) is provided (20-percent-capacity). The SUFP has the dual purpose of supplying feedwater during fill-up and low-load conditions when steam is not available to drive the main feed pump turbines and to allow plant operation at full power with one main SGFP out of service. Unit 1 has a common sensing line that feeds the low-pressure side of the net positive suction head (NPSH) differential pressure trip switches (PDS) for all SGFPs. The common sensing line utilizes a tee connection to split to both the SGFPs and SUFP with separate heat trace protection circuits (EHTR). The common sensing line is composed of stationary (no flow) quarter inch inner diameter stainless-steel tubing (TBG). A short segment (roughly five feet in length) of the common sensing line (that was uninsulated and without heat trace) runs into the turbine generator building (TGB) to six low-NPSH switches located inside the TGB for the SGFPs. Another branch of the common sensing line (that had heat trace and insulation) runs to two low-NPSH switches for the SUFP. The AFWS is designed to back up the main feedwater system during plant hot shutdown (or hot standby) in the event the main feedwater system and/or the SUFP is unavailable. The AFWS can be used as a means of continuous feedwater supply even if this condition is maintained for extended periods. The AFWS feedwater supply is the auxiliary feedwater storage tank (AFST) (TK). E. Narrative summary of the event On February 14, 2021, at 15:16 the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station entered a period of abnormally cold weather for the station. The temperatures dropped to 32 degrees Fahrenheit and continued to drop throughout the rest of the afternoon and night. Shortly after midnight, ice began to form in sensing lines on the Deaerator Structure (DEA). The first symptom was Deaerator pressure ""slowly failing high."" This was consistent with formation of ice. Over the next two hours, Deaerator Storage Tank #2 level indication failed low, and Deaerator inlet flow displayed ""bad data"" and then failed high. The Deaerator level control was transferred from automatic to manual control at 02:41 on February 15, 2021. On February 15, 2021, at 05:24, the Unit 1 SGFPs 11 & 13 tripped off-line due to an invalid low Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) trip input. The invalid trip signal resulted from ice that formed in the common sensing line of the low-pressure side of the NPSH switches. The ice formation increased the pressure on the low-pressure side and reduced the differential pressure to below the trip setpoint.",4982021001R00,4982021001R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
,Unknown Unit,Unit 1 Pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valve Failed To Open,3/18/2023,"On March 18, 2023, at 0933, during the shutdown of Unit 1 reactor for 1RE24, while in Mode 4 and performing surveillance procedure steps for Pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valve (PORV) PCV-0656A, the valve failed to open. The surveillance was successfully reperformed later that shift and the valve was declared operable. The capability of the PORV to meet its design function for manual control of RCS pressure if it had been called upon to perform its safety functions from 11/3/2021 to 3/18/2023, was not assured. Therefore, PORV 0656A was considered to have been inoperable during this time. On 1/4/2023, from 0757 until 1431, the PORVs could not have fulfilled their safety function for manual control of RCS pressure under postulated design basis conditions, because the second PORV 0655A was unavailable due to scheduled maintenance. The event was determined to be reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications and per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. The cause of the event was determined to be inadequate guidance in the PORV maintenance procedure and inadequate implementation of a design change package. Corrective actions include revising and updating procedures and documentation.","I. Description of Event A. Reportable Event Classification This event is reportable per 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specification and per 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. Reporting Criterion 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) is ?Å“Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plants Technical Specifications except when: (1) The Technical Specification is administrative in nature; (2) The event consisted solely of a case of a late surveillance test where the oversight was corrected, the test was performed, and the equipment was found to be capable of performing its specified safety functions; or (3) The Technical Specification was revised prior to discovery of the event such that the operation or condition was no longer prohibited at the time of discovery of the event.??The Technical Specification action statement for an inoperable PORV due to excessive seat leakage allows continued operation with the associated block closed because manual operation of the PORV is still available. In contrast, the action statement for a PORV inoperable for reasons other than excessive seat leakage states: ?Å“restore the PORV to OPERABLE status or close the associated block valve and remove power from the block valve; within the following 72 hours restore the PORV to OPERABLE status??... ?Å“or be in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours and in HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 6 hours.??In this event, the plant operated throughout the entire duration of Cycle 24 with PCV-0656A most likely not capable of meeting design requirements. This period exceeds the 72-hour allowed outage time of Technical Specification 3.4.4 Limiting Condition for Operations Action (b) for a PORV inoperable due to causes other than excessive seat leakage. Therefore, this event is considered reportable per 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. Reporting Criterion 50.73(a)(2)(v) is ?Å“Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to: (A) Shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B) Remove residual heat; (C) Control the release of radioactive material; or (D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident.??Only one pressurizer PORV is required for RCS pressure control to reach safe shutdown or to mitigate the consequences of a steam generator tube rupture. Pressurizer PORV PCV-0655A never experienced excessive seat leakage during Cycle 24. Plant computer data and Unit 1 control room logs were reviewed for the duration of Cycle 24 to identify any periods when PCV-0655A was declared inoperable. From January 4, 2023, at 0750 until January 5, 2023, at 0415, the 125 Volt DC Bus which is the power supply for PCV-0655A was inoperable for surveillance testing. On January 4, 2023, a performance discharge test was performed on the 125 Volt DC Bus in accordance surveillance procedures. During the surveillance, the 125 Volt DC Bus breaker was opened, leaving the 125 Volt DC Bus powered by the battery chargers. Computer history shows the breaker was opened at 0757 and was closed at 1431 on January 4, 2023. During those six and a half hours, PORV PCV-0655A would not have power to actuate the Solenoid Operated Valve (SOV) to open the PORV if there was a loss of offsite power and either Standby Diesel Generator #11 or the 125 Volt DC Bus was not promptly restored. Because the safety related design function of the PORVs is manual RCS pressure control with a loss of offsite power, from 0757 until 1431 on January 4, 2023, the PORVs could not have fulfilled their safety function for manual control of RCS pressure.

South Texas,2,Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications Due to Inoperable Containment Isolation Valve,7/1/2021,"On July 1, 2021, at 2344 hours, the STP Nuclear Operating Company discovered that Steam Generator 2D outside reactor containment isolation valve FV-4150 was indicating valve closure but only reduced the flow rate by about 8.33%. On July 2, 2021, at 0350 hours, the valve was declared inoperable due to inadequate isolation. Site engineering determined on July 12, 2021, that FV-4150 was inoperable since March 29, 2021, due to preventative maintenance performed on that date. On July 3, 2021, FV-4150 was determined to be operable following a valve stem adjustment and a satisfactory performance of the surveillance test. The causes of the event were associated with inadequate written guidance. This event is reportable because the Technical Specification 3.6.3 required action statement for an inoperable containment isolation valve was not met. Specifically, the containment isolation valve was inoperable from March 29, 2021, to July 3, 2021, for a total of 96 days. The allowed outage time is 24 hours or apply the requirements of the configuration risk management program. Planned corrective actions include revising the work instructions and the post-maintenance testing guidance.","Description of Reportable Event A. Reportable event classification This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because the Technical Specification 3.6.3 required action statement for an inoperable containment isolation valve was not met. B. Plant operating conditions prior to event Prior to the event, Unit 2 was at 100% power in Mode 1. C. Status of structures, systems, and components that were INOPERABLE at the start of the event and that contributed to the event No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event. D. Background information The steam generator blowdown system provides the means to continuously blowdown the steam generator to maintain the prescribed water chemistry in the steam generators. The system also removes dissolved solids and corrosion products from the blowdown stream to make it suitable for reuse in the condenser hotwell. The steam generator blowdown system is a closed system. Steam Generator 2D outside reactor containment isolation valve FV-4150 meets the requirements in General Design Criteria 57 for Closed Systems Isolation Valves. There was no open pathway between the reactor containment building and the outside. E. Narrative summary of the event Note: all times are Central Daylight Time On July 1, 2021, at 2344 hours, a condition report was written documenting that during the performance of the steam generator blowdown system valve operability test, Steam Generator 2D outside reactor containment isolation valve FV-4150 local valve indication showed closed. However, the flow across the valve only reduced from about 36 klb/hr to about 33 klb/hr. On July 2, 2021, at 0350 hours, FV-4150 was declared inoperable due to inadequate isolation. Corrective maintenance was performed on the valve on July 2, 2021. The as-found condition was described as ""craft identified valve was not making contact with the valve seat."" The valve stem was screwed out three turns from the marriage block, adjusting the valve stroke to bring the valve plug to the seat. This indicated the valve stroke was slightly short, not allowing the plug to contact the valve seat. FV-4150 is quick-opening, thus only a slight distance between the seat and the plug is necessary for the valve to allow a large percentage of flow through while closed. On July 3, 2021, at 0501 hours, FV-4150 passed the steam generator blowdown system valve operability test and was declared operable. Site engineering determined on July 12, 2021, that the valve stroke length inaccuracy was the result of an actuator overhaul preventative maintenance activity that was completed on March 29, 2021, during the most recent refueling outage (2RE21). The scope of the preventative maintenance was to disassemble the actuator, replace soft parts and worn or damaged parts, measure the free length of the actuator spring, replace air filter, and reassemble. Under this preventative maintenance, the actuator stem is removed, and the stroke of the actuator is adjusted. F. Method of discovery This event was self-revealed when FV-4150 did not pass the quarterly surveillance test due to inadequate isolation.

South Texas Project,2,Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications due to Inoperable Train of Essential Core Cooling System and Containment Spray System,10/15/2021,"On October 15, 2021, at 0133 hours, the South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC) started High Head Safety Injection (HHSI) Pump 2B for SI Accumulator 2B fill. Neither the HHSI pump room fans nor the containment sump isolation valve cubicle fans auto started as expected. The B-Train Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) and Containment Spray were declared inoperable. On October 15, 2021, at 1319 hours, troubleshooting commenced and determined the cause for the failure was the B-Train hand switch (B2HFHS9527) was sticking and needed to be replaced. On October 15, 2021, at 2318 hours, Operations declared B-Train ECCS and Containment Spray operable following completion of corrective maintenance. On October 27, 2021, at 2058 hours the event was determined to be reportable by Operations as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications because the required action statements for Technical Specifications 3.5.2 and 3.6.2.1 were not met. A planned corrective action resulting from this event is to improve the process of requiring retention of defective components. Completed corrective actions resulting from this event include the replacement of the B train hand switch, evaluation of operating experience against the risk of de-terming and re-terming the hand switch given its proximity to other switches, and inspection of four other hand switches to determine effectiveness of current PMs.","I. Description of Reportable Event A. Reportable event classification This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because the South Texas Project (STP) Technical Specification 3.5.2 required action statements for an inoperable Essential Core Cooling System (ECCS) and Technical Specification 3.6.2.1 required action statements for an inoperable Containment Spray System were not met.

Status of structures, systems, and components that were inoperable at the start of the event and that contributed to the event No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event. D. Background Information Unit 2 Control Room hand switch (B2HFHS9527), hereafter referred to as the B-Train hand switch, can be operated to turn on the fans that provide cooling for the B-Train Safety Injection (SI) Pump and Containment Spray (CS) Pump cubicles. The B-Train hand switch failed which prevented the cooling fans in air handling units VAH-005 and VAH-013 from starting automatically as designed when High Head Safety Injection (HHSI) Pump 2B was started for testing. The B-Train hand switch is a General Electric SBM rotary control hand switch, which are used widely throughout industry and at South Texas Project Electric Generating Station (STPEGS). This B-Train hand switch is designed with a manual start position which can start the SI pump valve room VAH-005 fan from the control room, a STOP position to secure the fan, a pull-to-lock position to completely deenergize power to the fans for personal safety and for maintenance, and an AUTO position that allows the cooling fans to start automatically when HHSI Pump 2B is started. Once the fan motors are started, they continue to run until an operator manually stops the fans with the B-Train hand switch. The status of the fans (on/off) can be confirmed in the Control Room by computer point readout. The function of the VAH-005 and VAH-013 supplemental cooler units is to provide cooling in Fuel Handling Building (FHB) Room 005 and FHB Room 008 which contain the B-Train SI pumps and the Containment Spray Pump. Elevated temperatures in these rooms are detected by thermostats and the VAH-005 and VAH-013 fans are designed to start automatically on high temperature. The fan startup circuits are also interlocked with the startup and running of any one of the pumps in the room. The FHB Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) System maintains the normal environmental conditions required to ensure the operability of the system components that are located inside the Fuel Handling Building. During normal operation, the supply air subsystem provides the building with a filtered source of outside air at the proper temperature.

South Texas,2,' Automatic Actuati . _of_Fmera- .  ?? - Generator due to I or:ri it of Switchyard Electrical Bus_,1/6/2022,"On January 06, 2022, with both units operating at 100% power, the South Texas Project 345 kV south switchyard electrical bus unexpectedly de-energized. The de-energization of the south bus resulted in a loss of power to the Unit 2 standby transformer which was supplying power to the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) 4160V busses for the Unit 2 B Train. The associated Emergency Diesel Generator 22 automatically started in response to the undervoltage condition, as designed. The cause of this event was an electrical flashover on a Transmission Distribution Service Provider owned insulator on the south bus. This event is reportable as an event which resulted in the automatic actuation of the Unit 2 emergency AC electrical power systems. Corrective actions included replacing the insulator, performing inspections for abnormal electrical Corona on the insulators (no adverse values were found), and cleaning of the other insulators on the North and South bus. There were no previous indications of issues with the insulator. The event did not result in any offsite release of radioactivity or increase of offsite dose rates and there were no personnel injuries or damage to any safety-related equipment associated with this event. Additionally, all ESF equipment operated as designed. Therefore, there was no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public.","I. Description of Reportable Event A. Reportable event classification This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in the valid actuation of an emergency AC electrical power system (50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(8)). B. Plant operating conditions prior to event Prior to the event on January 6, 2022, STP Unit 2 was at 100% power in Mode 1. C. Status of structures, systems, and components that were inoperable at the start of the event and that contributed to the event No other structures, systems, or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event. D. Background information The Offsite Electrical System consists of two standby transformers, the 138 kV emergency transformer, two main power transformers, 345 kV lines connecting the main power transformers and the standby transformers to the switchyard, the 345 kV switchyard, nine 345 kV transmission circuits from the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station (STPEGS) 345 kV switchyard to the interconnecting grids, and the 138 kV radial line connected to the 138 kV emergency transformer. The transmission system provides reliable sources of offsite power for supplying plant auxiliary power systems for plant startup, shutdown or at any time that power is unavailable from the unit's main generator. The standby transformers are individually supplied by separate and independent overhead 345 kV ties from the 345 kV switchyard, one from the south bus and one from the north bus. Each standby transformer normally supplies B Train Engineered Safety Features (ESF) busses in each unit. The ESF busses in each unit can be aligned to be powered from either the Unit 1 or the Unit 2 standby transformer. Per STP Technical Specification (T.S.) 3.8.1.1.e, with two of the above required offsite A.C. circuits inoperable, within 24 hours restore at least one of the inoperable offsite sources to OPERABLE status or apply the requirements of the Configuration Risk Management Program (CRMP) or be in at least HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours. Unit 2 entered T.S. Action 3.8.1.1.e. in response to this event. E. Narrative summary of the event On January 06, 2022, at 06:03 with both units operating at 100% power, a south bus lockout occurred that caused an engineered safety system to actuate and momentarily de-energize the bus to clear the fault. The 345kV was automatically restored successfully. This momentary loss of the 345 kV south bus in the switchyard caused the Unit 2 ESF bus to lockout and transfer to the ESF Unit 2 Train B Standby Diesel Generator 22 as designed. The control room received reports of a visible flash observed in the switchyard at 06:10. A second event at 07:43 of a clear flashover was observed by onsite Transmission Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) personnel.

Completed corrective actions include completion of Train B Essential Chilled Water System planned maintenance on November 17, 2023, and corrective maintenance to replace a failed relay and blown fuse on the Train C Essential Chiller local control panel.","I. Description of Reportable Event A. Reportable Event Classification This event is reportable pursuant to 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) because the South Texas Project (STP) Design Basis Document (DBD) for the Essential Chilled Water System states that the system provides cooling water to the safety- related Air Handler Unit (AHU) for the Control Room Envelope (CRE) during normal and accident conditions. The CRE HVAC system DBD states that two of the three essential chilled water system trains are needed to maintain the CRE HVAC safety function requirements in the event of a Safety Injection (SI) signal. With only one of three Essential Chilled Water system trains operable from 1541 on November 16, 2023, to 1702 on November 18, 2023, the CRE HVAC system may have not been able to meet all safety function requirements in the event of an accident.

South Texas,2,Automatic Actuation of Emergency Diesel Generator due to Lockout of Switchyard Electrical Bus,12/2/2023,"On December 2, 2023, with both units operating at 100% power, the South Texas Project (STP) 345 kV south switchyard electrical bus unexpectedly de-energized. The de-energization of the south bus resulted in a loss of power to the Unit 2 standby transformer which was supplying power to the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) 4160V busses for the Unit 2 B Train. The associated Emergency Diesel Generator 22 automatically started in response to the under- voltage condition, as designed. The cause of this event was the failure of a stand-off insulator occurring on Phase ?Å“A??in 13.8kV Terminal Cabinet. A root cause could not be determined after Engineering evaluations. Corrective actions included replacing the insulator and performing visual inspections of both the transformer and bus for signs of arcing and/or water intrusion. There were no previous indications of issues with the insulator. This event is reportable as an event which resulted in the automatic actuation of the Unit 2 emergency AC electrical power systems. Additionally, all ESF equipment operated as designed.","I. Description of Reportable Event A. Reportable event classification This event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in the valid actuation of an emergency AC electrical power system (50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B)(8)). B. Plant operating conditions before the event Prior to the event on December 2, 2023, STP Unit 2 was at 100% power in Mode 1. C. Status of structures, systems, and components that were inoperable at the start of the event and that contributed to the event No other structures, systems or components were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event. D. Background information The Offsite Electrical System consists of two standby transformers, the 138kV emergency transformer, two main power transformers, 345kV lines connecting the main power transformers and the standby transformers to the switch yard, the 345kV switch yard, nine 345kV transmission circuits from the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station (STPEGS) 345kV switchyard to the interconnecting grids, and the 138kV radial line connected to the 138kV emergency transformer. The transmission system provides reliable sources of offsite power for supplying plant auxiliary power systems for plant startup, shutdown or at any time that power is unavailable from the unit's main generator. The standby transformers are individually supplied by separate and independent overhead 345kV ties from the 345kV switchyard. These 345kV ties to the standby transformers are connected by two separate 345kV busses (north and south) in the switchyard. Each standby transformer has the capacity to supply all Engineered Safety Features (ESF) busses in both Units and two 13.8kV auxiliary busses. These transformers can be shared between Units 1 and 2 and can supply the two preferred power sources (the north and south 345kV busses). Per STP Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1.1.e, with two of the above required offsite AC circuits inoperable, within 24 hours restore at least one of the inoperable offsite sources to OPERABLE status or apply the requirements of the Configuration Risk Management Program (CRMP) or be in at least HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours. Unit 2 entered Technical Specification Actions 3.8.1.1.e. in response to this event. E. Narrative summary of the event On 12/2/2023 at 06:10 Unit 2 Control Room received annunciators 10M2-B-3 ""345kV South Bus Diff"" and 10M2-A-4 ""345kV BKR Y610 Trip"". The Control Room observed indication that Switchyard Breaker Y610 had tripped open, and the 345kV Switchyard South Bus was de-energized. The following Standby Transformer 2 relays tripped: 51N-ST2Y, both 85N relays, 86-ST2B, and 86-ST2A. Standby Transformer 2 experienced a lockout resulting in Emergency Diesel Generator 22 (EDG22) starting to supply power to the standby bus. This resulted in loss of two offsite sources due to one ESF bus not being connected to a load tap changer in automatic and standby bus not being available. On 12/2/23 at 08:30 the 4160V Bus E2B was powered from U1 standby transformer. On 12/2/23 at 12:35 the South Bus was re-energized after CenterPoint (Transmission Distribution Service Provider) opened disconnect S024 to remove Standby Transformer 2 from the South Bus.",4992023002R00,4992023002R00,50.73.(a)(2)(iv)(A),System Actuation,Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section
